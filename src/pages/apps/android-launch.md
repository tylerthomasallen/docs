## Submitting to the Play Store

If you'd like Branch to collect the [Google Advertising ID](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248) for advertising or tracking purposes instead of the Android ID, you must add Google Play Services to your app prior to release. After you complete these steps, Branch will handle the rest!

1. Add `compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:9+'` or greater version to the dependencies section of your `build.gradle` file. You might already have it.
1. Add the following line in your Proguard settings:

```xml
-keep class com.google.android.gms.ads.identifier.** { *; }
```

!!! note "Why does Branch use the GAID?"
    Branch uses the GAID to identify users across our entire partner network, greatly increasing match accuracy rate. You can read more about this on the [matching accuracy page](/pages/resources/matching/). You do not need to perform these steps if you elect **not** to import Play Services or the Ads framework.
    
    
## Google Play Analytics

Branch has the ability to send UTM data to Google Play. When you specify the following keys on your Branch links, we will pass them to Google Play.

If you specify `utm_source` as a query parameter or key value pair on any Branch link, we will pass this to Google Play. If you don't specify a `utm_source`, we will use the `~channel` specified on the Branch link. If there is no channel, the default will be `Branch`.

The same applies for `utm_campaign`, except, we will fall back to `~campaign`, and then not pass anything if `~campaign` is not specified.
