## Overview

Integration with Fabric's Answers is totally automatic as long as you've integrated both Branch and Answers. Branch will automatically send the following three events to Answers:

- `Branch Install`: This event is sent when a user installs your app after clicking a Branch link.
- `Branch Open`: This event is sent when a user clicks a Branch link but already has your app installed.
- `Branch Share`: This event is sent when the has shared a link on a channel using the [Branch share sheet]({{base.url}}/getting-started/branch-universal-object/guide/ios/#showsharesheetwithlinkproperties).

With every single event that's recorded, the following custom Branch link analytics labels are sent as Answers event attributes *if present*:

- `channel`
- `campaign`
- `feature`
- `stage`
- `tags`
- `referring_link`
