## Overview

The Branch partnership with [Braze](https://www.braze.com) provides a push-button way to deliver Branch-referred iOS installs and attributions to your Braze dashboard. This allows you to analyze your users coming in from Branch deep linked campaigns.

**At this time, our integration only applies to the iOS platform.**

### How it works

We have built a custom integration to automatically send all Branch-referred iOS install data to Braze without any extra work on your side (besides integrating both the Branch and Braze SDKs). Simply click a button, and you'll be good to go!

!!! protip "How do we differentiate Braze and Branch installs?"
    We rely on a Branch link being clicked, which leads to an install. This sets an internal boolean that an install came from Branch.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- This guide requires you to have already integrated the Branch mobile SDKs into your app.
- You also need to [sign up for an Braze account](https://dashboard.braze.com/developers/sign_up) and [install the Braze SDK](https://documentation.braze.com/).
- Ensure Braze's SDK is [collecting the IDFA](https://documentation.braze.com/iOS/#optional-idfa-collection).

### Get the Braze API key

1. On the Braze dashboard, navigate to the **App Settings** section, and click **3rd Party Integrations**.

### Braze Endpoints.

By default, Branch uses the new Braze endpoint https://rest.iad-01.braze.com. If your Braze app is using a different Braze endpoint please contact your Branch account manager or reach out to us at [integrations@branch.io](mailto:integrations@branch.io). If you are not sure what endpoint your app uses please open a support ticket with Braze or use the [Braze REST Endpoint table](https://www.braze.com/documentation/REST_API/#endpoints) to find your correct REST endpoint.
