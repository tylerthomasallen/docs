## Overview

With a push of a button you can send your Branch data to your mParticle dashboard, helping you to understand the power of Branch as an acquisition pathway, export your data to your entire suite of analytics tools and build custom audiences upon Branch data.

This documentation explains how to send **Branch install events to mParticle**. mParticle calls this an Inbound Feed Integration. If you'd like to send mParticle events to your Branch dashboard through your app, please review the Branch/mParticle SDK Kit integration documentation for [iOS](/pages/apps/mparticle-ios/) and [Android](/pages/apps/mparticle-android/). At present there is no server to server integration for sending mParticle data to Branch.

### How does it work?

Once the Branch SDK is integrated into an app, Branch can detect which links are leading to installs, re-opens, and users' actions. Enabling this integration and providing your mParticle key/secret will result in Branch automatically forwarding attributed installs to mParticle, in the exact format mParticle expects.

### What events does Branch send?

Branch will send **attributed installs**. Branch also sends all the data that is attached to the link that drove the attributed installs. This will allow you to analyze which campaigns, channels, etc. are helping you acquire and engage users. You can see the list of fields that we send to mParticle [here](#what-branch-sends-to-mparticle).

### What does it look like?

Branch events will appear as an attribution event in mParticle. You can then export Branch data to your other data sources.

Branch attribution events are mapped as follows:

- Event Type = Custom Event
- Custom Event Type = attribution
- Event Name = attribution

For information on how to test your integration and see more detailed data, please review our [testing instructions below](#testing-your-integration).

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- This guide requires you to have already integrated the Branch and mParticle mobile SDK(s).
- This guide requires you to have the [AdSupportFramework](https://docs.branch.io/pages/apps/ios-launch/#submitting-to-the-app-store) on iOS and [Google Play Services library](https://docs.branch.io/pages/apps/android-launch/#submitting-to-the-play-store) on Android.

### Retrieve mParticle Key & Secret

Find your mParticle key & secret and enter it into the Branch Dashboard.

1. Navigate to [https://app.mparticle.com](https://app.mparticle.com) and log into the Dashboard.
1. In the dashboard, navigate to the **[Directory](https://app.mparticle.com/directory)** and search for Branch .
1. Click the Branch tile, and click **Add Branch Metrics to Setup**
1. Select the **Input Feed** Integration Type and click **Add to Setup**

    ![image](/img/pages/integrations/mparticle/mparticle-add-feed-to-setup.png)

1. You should now be looking at a list of Feed Configurations. If you don't see Branch in the list, refresh the page. Hover over Branch and click _Configure_.

    ![image](/img/pages/integrations/mparticle/mparticle-list-of-feeds.png)

1. Specify the following configuration parameters:
    - Configuration Name
    - Act as Application _(select the right platform here)_

## Testing your integration

To see the data being passed to mParticle in more detail, you can set up a webhook to Requestbin. This will allow you to send only a subset of your Branch events to Requestbin and verify the data is coming through as expected. 

1. Enable the Branch Data Integration above. Install your app from a Branch link to generate some data in mParticle. It can take up to an hour for the custom attributes to show in mParticle. 
1. Create a Branch link from the Quick Links section of the dashboard, with a campaign of *branch_test*.

    ![image](/img/pages/integrations/mparticle/mparticle-test-link.png)

1. In mParticle, navigate to the Directory in mParticle and add **Webhooks** as an option. Add a Requestbin URL generated from [https://requestb.in](https://requestb.in).

    ![image](/img/pages/integrations/mparticle/mparticle-add-webhooks.png)

1. To refine the data being sent to the webhook, navigate to **Connections > Connect**. 
1. Select your OS as the input, and **Webhooks** as the output.
1. Set a filter to filter on *campaign* and put the campaign name of *branch_test* that you added in your Branch link. 

    ![image](/img/pages/integrations/mparticle/mparticle-webhook-forwarding-rule.png)

1. Finally, view the Requestbin. You can do this by appending **?inspect** to your requestbin URL. You should be able to copy paste the POST body from the request bin into a JSON formatter like [https://jsonlint.com/](https://jsonlint.com/) to view the event details.
