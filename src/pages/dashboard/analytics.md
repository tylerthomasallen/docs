## Understand tracking 

- #### Analytical behavior
    - Whenever a user `clicks` on a deep link and `opens` the app
    - This triggers either an `install` or an `open` (`re-open`)
        - `installs` represent Branch recognizing the app_id and device_id for the first time
        - `installs` represent new app users and the success rate of your Branch deep links
        - `installs` do **not** represent App Store downloads
        - `non-Branch installs` are installs outside of Branch deep link clicks
        - `opens` are non-installs
        - If a user uninstalls and reinstalls the app, this will be an `open` because Branch recognizes the device
        - If a user has the app and clicks a Branch deep link, this will be an `open` because the user is not new

- #### Dashboard behavior
    - The [Branch Dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/) is a great tool for measuring growth and engagement of your app
    - Branch tracks `click`, `installs`, and `opens` (`re-opens`) for both Branch related events and non-Branch related events
    - The values of the dropdowns are limited to the data within the `date range`
    - `Untracked` means this metric is non-Branch related (e.g. installs that don't come from Branch deep links)
    - `Unspecified` means that this metric does not have the selected filter (e.g. the Campaign field for the deep link is blank)

## Dashboard pages

- #### Summary
    - The [Dashboard Summary](https://dashboard.branch.io/) shows a high level overview of the success of your deep linking

    - Find more information in [Deepviews](/pages/web/deep-views/)
    - Deepviews also help deep links work in all platforms [Supported Platforms](/pages/links/integrate/#expected-redirect-behavior)

- #### Desktop SMS
    - The [Dashboard Text Me The App](https://dashboard.branch.io/) allows you to send a deep link with in a text message to users to convert desktop users to app users
    - Find more information in [Text Me The App](/pages/web/text-me-the-app/)

- #### Ads
    - [Dashboard Ads](https://dashboard.branch.io/email) allows you to easily integrate Branch deep links with your email providers
    - Find more information in [Ads](/pages/deep-linked-ads/dynamic-product-feeds/)

- #### Emails
    - [Dashboard Emails](https://dashboard.branch.io/email) allows you to easily integrate Branch deep links with your email providers

- #### Organic Search

    - [Dashboard Organic Search](https://dashboard.branch.io/search) shows you how your deep links and content are being scraped by search engines
    - Use [app indexing](#dialog-code) within your app to enable
    - Validate with the [App indexing validator](https://branch.io/resources/app-indexing/)

- #### Referrals

    - [Dashboard Referrals](https://dashboard.branch.io/referrals/analytics) allows you to track referrals between users  

    - ##### Implementing

        - Referrer has their [identity set](#dialog-code)
        - Referrer `creates` a deep link
        - Referrer `shares` the deep link
        - Referee `clicks` on the deep link
        - Referee has their [identity set](#dialog-code)
        - Referee triggers a [custom event](#dialog-code)
        - The custom event triggers a [Reward rule](https://dashboard.branch.io/referrals/rules) to assign referral points

    - ##### Troubleshooting

        - The Referrer and Referee are connected by the `deep link`
        - Referring points happen whenever the `custom event` occurs in the app which triggers the `referral rule`
        - It is best to assign referring points on a `custom event` rather than Branch events (install and open) to prevent referral abuse
        - Make sure you set the identity of both the referrer and referee to prevent anonymous users from showing up in your [Referral analytics](https://dashboard.branch.io/referrals/analytics)
        - Referrals are based on a `session`, not a device. If a user closes and opens the app before triggering the referral rule, then the referral points will not be delivered
        - If your referrals are based on custom install event, then you will need to uninstall the app and [simulate a Branch install](#dialog-code) to test referrals
        - A [Reward rule](https://dashboard.branch.io/referrals/rules) with `All acting users` will trigger credits even if a referral did not happen. To only reward credits on a referral, use `Referring users` or `Referred acting users`

    - ##### Tracking
        - Use the [Referral analytics](https://dashboard.branch.io/referrals/analytics)
        - Use the [LiveView export](https://dashboard.branch.io/liveview/link_clicks) to get data as a `.csv`
        - Create a [Webhook](/pages/exports/webhooks) to send data to your server
        - Request a whitelisting to our [Data Export API](/pages/exports/api)

    - ##### Querying
        - Query the events export the custom referral event that triggered the referral rule
        - The `developer identity` of this event is your referee
        - The `session referring developer identity` is your referrer

- #### Quick Links
    - [Dashboard Quick Links](https://dashboard.branch.io/quick-links) allows you to quickly create deep links and track their analytics in the dashboard
    - Use the `Click Link` button in the header to generate a quick link

    - Use the `Event` dropdown to see a funnel of your analytics to a [custom event](#dialog-code) inside your app
    - Use the `Export` button to get a email with a `.cvs` of your source data

## Troubleshoot issues

<!-- - #### Revenue analytics -->

- #### User value attribution

    - Measure app growth through automatic `event tracking` and `user identity` tracking
    - Use [Configure you app](#dialog-code) to send events and user information (`email`, `ID`, `UUID`, etc) from your app to the [Branch dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/)
    - The `identity` is retroactively associate any previously recorded events
    - Define all the custom events (`signups`, `purchases`, `shares`, etc.) you want to track
    - Branch automatically creates certain events whenever a user accesses your site or your app:

        | Key | Value
        | --- | ---
        | `install` | Triggered the first time a user launches your app
        | `open` | Triggered whenever the app becomes active (includes reinstalls)
        | `referred session` | Triggered in addition to install, open or web session start if a user comes from a Branch link
        | `web session start` | Triggered when the user views a webpage using the Branch Web SDK.

- #### Growth attribution

    - You can measure your app growth in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io) through automatic event tracking and user identity tracking.
        - You can also define as many custom events (signups, purchases, shares, etc.) as you wish - see the [User Value Attribution](/pages/dashboard/analytics/#user-value-attribution) guide for more on tracking custom events. You can see these events as they occur on the Live View > Events page.

        - You must [identify your users](/pages/dashboard/analytics/#growth-attribution) in order for the `User ID` column to be populated. The `Branch ID` refers to the internal Branch ID associated with that user. The `Developer ID` is the value you assign when you set the identity
        - You must [Setting Identities](#dialog-code?ios=track-users&android=track-users&adobe-air=track-users&cordova-phonegap-ionic=track-users&mparticle-android=track-users&mparticle-ios=track-users&titanium=track-users&react-native=track-users&unity=track-users&xamarin=track-users) within your app

        - Measuring influencers
        The [Analytics](https://dashboard.branch.io/referrals/analytics) page on the dashboard will show you who is driving the most new signups.
