  - Branch reserved keys

    | Prefix | Usage |
    | --- | --- |
    | $ | Branch reserved keyword
    | ~ | Branch analytical data
    | + | Branch added values

#### Analytical labels

  - For [Create Deep Link](#create-deep-link) and [Share Deep Link](#share-deep-link)

    | Key | Default | Usage
    | --- | --- | ---
    | channel | | Use channel to tag the route that your link reaches users. For example, tag links with `'Facebook'` or `'LinkedIn'` to help track clicks and installs through those paths separately
    | feature | | This is the feature of your app that the link might be associated with. For example, if you had built a referral program, you would label links with the feature ‘referral’
    | campaign | | Use this field to organize the links by actual campaign. For example, if you launched a new feature or product and want to run a campaign around that
    | stage | | Use this to categorize the progress or category of a user when the link was generated. For example, if you had an invite system accessible on level 1, level 3 and 5, you could differentiate links generated at each level with this parameter
    | tags | | This is a free form entry with unlimited values `['string']`. Use it to organize your link data with labels that don’t fit within the bounds of the above
    | alias | | Specify a link alias in place of the standard encoded short URL e.g. `yourdomain.com/youralias`. Link aliases are unique, immutable objects that cannot be deleted. You cannot change the alias of existing links. Aliases on the legacy `bnc.lt` domain are incompatible with Universal Links and Spotlight
    | type | `0` | Must be an `int`. Set to `1` to limit deep link to a single use. Set to `2` to make the link show up under [Quick Links](https://dashboard.branch.io/marketing) while adding `$marketing_title` to `data`. Does not work with the Native SDKs.
