## Understand deep linking

- ### Default link behavior

    - Your app is not installed

        - User `clicks` on a Branch deep link

        - Device `navigates` to the [fallback](#fallback-to-a-specific-url) (e.g. an app store or website)

        - User `installs` and `opens` app

        - Branch passes deep link `data` into app

    - Your app is installed

        -  User `clicks` on a Branch deep link

        -  Device `opens` app

        -  Branch passes deep link `data` into app

- #### Expected redirect behavior

    - Your app is not installed

        - Device `navigates` to the [fallback](#fallback-to-a-specific-url) (e.g. an app store or website)

    - Your app is installed

        - If the app supports deep linking, then your app will open or navigate to the [fallback](#fallback-to-a-specific-url)

        - `*Able to force app open` using [`$uri_redirect_mode`](#forced-redirections) or enabling a [Deepview](/pages/web/deep-views/)

- ### Custom link behavior

    - ##### Pass data from link to app

        - Add [link data](#configure-deep-links) to each deep link

        - Add key-values pairs to your [Quick Links](/pages/dashboard/analytics/#quick-links)

        - Append query strings `https://example.app.link/fzmLEhobLD?$custom_data=123&hello=world`

    - ##### Fallback to a specific URL

        - Determine where a deep link will navigate to if either

            - Your app is not installed

            - *[or]* Another app prevent links from deep linking outside their app

        - Fallback overrides *(ordered by precedence)*
            - Add query string `https://example.app.link?$ios_url=https://example.com`
            - Add link data `$ios_url = 'https://example.com'` ([docs](/pages/links/integrate/#redirections))
            - Add link data `$fallback_url = 'https://example.com'` ([docs](/pages/links/integrate/#redirections))
            - Add link data for a deep view `$ios_deepview = 'deepviewId'`  ([docs](/pages/links/integrate/#deepview))
            - Enable a `Deep View` globally on the [Branch Dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/web/deepviews)
            - Add `iOS/Android Custom URL` on the [Branch Dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/link-settings)
            - Add `Default URL` (`$fallback_url`) on the [Branch Dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/link-settings)

    - ##### Open web instead of app
        - Your app is not installed
            - Device `navigates` to the [fallback](#fallback-to-a-specific-url) (e.g. an app store or website)
        - Your app is installed
            - *iOS:* need to override `Universal Links`
                - Add `$web_only = true` ([docs](/pages/links/integrate/#redirections))
                - Add redirect `$ios_url = 'https://google.com'` ([docs](/pages/links/integrate/#redirections))
                - *[or]* Append `/e/` to the deep link
                    - e.g. `https://example.app.link/fzmLEhobLD` -> `https://example.app.link/e/fzmLEhobLD`
            - *Android:* need to override `App Links`
                - Uncheck `Always Open App`, `Enable App Links` and then hit `Save` the [Branch Dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/link-settings)
                - Add redirect `$android_url = 'https://google.com'` ([docs](/pages/links/integrate/#redirections))
                - Add a broken URI Scheme with `$android_deeplink_path = 'random'` ([docs](/pages/links/integrate/#deep-linking))

- ### Social link behavior
    - Use [OG Tags](#open-graph) to display content as a preview card in Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, iMessage, etc.
        - Basics are `$og_title`, `$og_description`, and `$og_image_url`
    - Use [Deep Views]() to display content as a website
        - Increases [install attribution](https://branch.io/deepview/)
        - Completes deep linking experience in [certain apps](#expected-redirect-behavior)

## Create deep links

- ### Short links
    - Short links are the most common deep link
    - Short links encapsulate [link data](#configure-deep-links) inside them on link creation
        - e.g. existing link `https://example.app.link/fzmLEhobLD`
    - Short links can have additional data appended to them
        - e.g. dynamic link `https://example.app.link/fzmLEhobLD?content_id=123`
    - Methods of creating short links
        - Use [Quick Links](/pages/dashboard/analytics/#quick-links) for fast link creation and easy tracking
        - Use our [App SDK](#dialog-code?ios=create-deep-link&android=create-deep-link&adobe=create-deep-link&cordova=create-deep-link&mparticleAndroid=create-deep-link&mparticleIos=create-deep-link&titanium=create-deep-link&reactNative=create-deep-link&unity=create-deep-link&xamarin=create-deep-link) to create and share links within your app
        - Use our [Web SDK](/pages/web/integrate/#create-deep-link) to create to links convert web to app users
        - Use our [HTTP API](/pages/apps/api/#link-create) to programmatically create links from your server
        - Use our [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/branch-link-creator/pekdpppibljpmpbcjelehhnldnfbglgf) to generate links from your browser

- ### Long links
    - Long links can be created without a network call to Branch
    - Long links need [link data](#configure-deep-links) to be URI encoded as a query string
        - e.g. existing link `https://example.app.link/fzmLEhobLD?foo=bar&baz=456`
        - e.g. dynamic link `https://example.app.link/?foo=bar&baz=456`
    - Long links need a `/a/` and a [Branch Key](/pages/dashboard/integrate/#understand-the-branch-key) if you use a `custom link domain`
        - e.g. existing link `https://link.example.com/5NPh/p4M09KRLrD?foo=bar&baz=456`
        - e.g. dynamic link `https://link.example.com/a/key_live_kaFuWw8WvY7yn1d9yYiP8gokwqjV0Swt?foo=bar&baz=456`
    - Long links need a `/a/` and a [Branch Key](/pages/dashboard/integrate/#understand-the-branch-key) if you use a `bnc.lt`
        - e.g. existing link `https://bnc.lt/5NPh/p4M09KRLrD?foo=bar&baz=456`
        - e.g. dynamic link `https://bnc.lt/a/key_live_kaFuWw8WvY7yn1d9yYiP8gokwqjV0Swt?foo=bar&baz=456`

## Configure deep links

- ### Analytical labels

    - These labels allow you to filter and organize your deep links

        | Key | Default | Usage
        | --- | --- | ---
        | channel | | Use channel to tag the route that your link reaches users. For example, tag links with `'Facebook'` or `'LinkedIn'` to help track clicks and installs through those paths separately
        | feature | | This is the feature of your app that the link might be associated with. For example, if you had built a referral program, you would label links with the feature 'referral'
        | campaign | | Use this field to organize the links by actual campaign. For example, if you launched a new feature or product and want to run a campaign around that
        | stage | | Use this to categorize the progress or category of a user when the link was generated. For example, if you had an invite system accessible on level 1, level 3 and 5, you could differentiate links generated at each level with this parameter
        | tags | | This is a free form entry with unlimited values `['string']`. Use it to organize your link data with labels that don't fit within the bounds of the above
        | alias | | Specify a link alias to replace of the standard encoded short URL (e.g. `https://example.app.link/aQXXDHaxKF` -> `https://example.app.link/youralias`). Link aliases must be unique (a `409 error` will occur if you create an alias already taken). Appending a `/` will break the alias. `bnc.lt` link domain alias links are incompatible with Universal Links and Spotlight.
        | type | `0` | Must be an `int`. Set to `1` to limit deep link to a single use. Set to `2` to make the link show up under [Quick Links](https://dashboard.branch.io/marketing) while adding `$marketing_title` to `data`. Does not work with the Native SDKs.

- ### Custom data

    - Pass any custom data to be read inside your app

        | Key | Value | Usage
        | --- | --- | ---
        | random | `123` | Any key-value pair
        | custom_data | `true` | Any key-value pair
        | any_value | `{ 'random': 'dictionary' }` | Any key-value pair
        | look_at | `[1,2,3,4,5,6]` | Any key-value pair
        | nav_here | `content/123` | Any key-value pair

- ### Redirections

    - Navigate to different locations based on device information
    - Navigation URLs must be websites, not deep links

        | Key | Default | Usage
        | --- | --- | ---
        | $fallback_url | | Change the redirect endpoint for all platforms - so you don't have to enable it by platform. Note that Branch will forward all robots to this URL, which **overrides any OG tags** entered in the link.  System-wide Default URL (set in Link Settings)
        | $fallback_url_xx | | Change the redirect endpoint for all platforms based on a [lower-case Alpha-2 country code](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search). For example, `$fallback_url_de="..."` would redirect Germany deep link clicks. You should also set `$fallback_url` to act as the global redirect in addition to the country-specifc ones.
        | $desktop_url | | Change the redirect endpoint on desktops Text-Me-The-App page (set in Link Settings)
        | $ios_url | | Change the redirect endpoint for iOS  App Store page for your app (set in Link Settings)
        | $ipad_url | | Change the redirect endpoint for iPads `$ios_url` value
        | $android_url  | | Change the redirect endpoint for Android Play Store page for your app (set in Link Settings)
        | $samsung_url  | | Redirect to Samsung Galaxy Store on Samsung devices. Only link level control. Format should be `http://www.samsungapps.com/appquery/appDetail.as?appId=YOUR.PACKAGE.NAME`
        | $windows_phone_url  | | Change the redirect endpoint for Windows OS Windows Phone default URL (set in Link Settings)
        | $blackberry_url | | Change the redirect endpoint for Blackberry OS  BlackBerry default URL (set in Link Settings)
        | $fire_url | | Change the redirect endpoint for Amazon Fire OS Fire default URL (set in Link Settings)
        | $ios_wechat_url | | Change the redirect endpoint for WeChat on iOS devices `$ios_url` value
        | $android_wechat_url | | Change the redirect endpoint for WeChat on Android devices  `$android_url` value
        | $web_only | `false` | Force to open the `$fallback_url` instead of the app

- ### Forced redirections

    - Prevent error messages from other apps when Branch deep links are clicked

        | Key | Value | Usage
        | --- | --- | ---
        | $uri_redirect_mode | **0** | This is the default value that yields the standard behavior where we don't try to open the app if the user can see an error.
        | $uri_redirect_mode | **1** | Smart redirect mode. Same behavior as 0 until we know the user has the app installed through Branch persona data. In that case, force URI schemes to open the app.
        | $uri_redirect_mode | **2** | Forceful redirect mode. Always try to force open the app, even if it risks showing an error message when the app is not installed.

    - Best practices for the Branch Universal Object
        - Do
            - Set the `canonicalIdentifier` to a unique, de-duped value across instances of the app
            - Ensure that the `title`, `contentDescription` and `imageUrl` properly represent the object
            - Initialize the Branch Universal Object and call userCompletedAction with the `BranchEvent.VIEW` on page load
            - Call showShareSheet and createShortLink later in the life cycle, when the user takes an action that needs a link
            - Call the additional object events (purchase, share completed, etc) when the corresponding user action is taken
        - Do not
            - Set the same `title`, `contentDescription` and `imageUrl` across all objects
            - Wait to initialize the object and register views until the user goes to share
            - Wait to initialize the object until you conveniently need a link
            - Create many objects at once and register views in a `for` loop.


## Read deep links

- Deep link data gets sent from your link to your [app](#dialog-code?ios=read-deep-link&android=read-deep-link&adobe=read-deep-link&cordova=read-deep-link&mparticleAndroid=read-deep-link&mparticleIos=read-deep-link&titanium=read-deep-link&reactNative=read-deep-link&unity=read-deep-link&xamarin=read-deep-link) or [website](/pages/web/integrate/) integration

        | Prefix | Usage |
        | --- | --- |
        | $ | Branch reserved keyword
        | ~ | Branch analytical data
        | + | Branch added values

- ### Callback values

    - Additional properties read from the `initSession` within your [app](#dialog-code?ios=initialize-branch&android=initialize-branch&adobe=initialize-branch&cordova=initialize-branch&mparticleAndroid=initialize-branch&mparticleIos=initialize-branch&titanium=initialize-branch&reactNative=initialize-branch&unity=initialize-branch&xamarin=initialize-branch) and [website](/pages/web/integrate/) integrations

        | Key | Default | Usage
        | --- | --- | ---
        | ~id | | Automatically generated 18 digit ID number for the link that drove the install/open, if present (0 for dynamic and 3P links)
        | ~referring_link | | The referring link that drove the install/open, if present
        | ~creation_source | |  Where the link was created (`0` API , `1` Quick Link, `2` SDK, `3` iOS SDK , `4` Android SDK , `5` Web SDK, `6` A links, `7` Dynamic, `8` Third party)
        | +match_guaranteed | | If the match was made with 100% accuracy
        | +referrer | | The referrer for the link click, if a link was clicked
        | +phone_number | | The phone number of the user, if the user texted himself/herself the app
        | +is_first_session | `false` | `true` if first session (install), `false` if any other session (open)
        | +clicked_branch_link | `false` | Whether or not the user clicked a Branch link that triggered this session
        | +non_branch_link | | App was opened from a non Branch link (third party, invalid Branch deep link, or Branch key mismatch)

## Troubleshoot issues

- ### Deep links do not open app
    - Make sure you are clicking on a deep link (e.g. `https://example.app.link/fzmLEhobLD`)
    - Make sure you are not pasting a deep link in the address bar (in most cases, deep links must be clicked on)
    - Make sure the deep link is not wrapped (e.g. `http://bit.ly/2yz3b8D` instead of `https://example.app.link/fzmLEhobLD`)
    - Make sure you have [configure your dashboard](/pages/dashboard/integrate/) and [configure your app](#dialog-code)
    - Make sure the `Branch key` [in your app](#dialog-code) matches the `Branch key` [in your deep link](#view-deep-link-data)
    - Make sure you have not [disabled universal linking on iOS](/pages/apps/ios/#re-enable-universal-linking)
    - Make sure you understand the [expected behavior of deep links](#expected-redirect-behavior)
    - Make sure the deep link domain matches your [link domain](https://dashboard.branch.io/link-settings) (e.g. link domain = `example.app.link`, deep link = `https://example.app.link/fzmLEhobLD`)

- ### View deep link data
    - Add `?debug=1` to the end of your deep link
    - For example: https://example.app.link/aQXXDHaxKF?debug=1
