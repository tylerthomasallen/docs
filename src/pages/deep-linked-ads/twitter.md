## Overview

Configuring Twitter install ads to use Branch links is very simple. The only trick is that you will be using the website click/conversion ads instead of the standard app install ad. Using Branch links allows you to track ad-driven installs on the Branch dashboard and deep link those new users directly to content the first time they open your app.


## Setup

### Prerequisites

To track installs from Twitter you should integrate the Branch SDK into your app. If you want to deep link from your ads directly to content, you should configure deep link routing.

### Enable Twitter as an ad partner

1. Visit the [Ads page](https://dashboard.branch.io/ads) on the Branch dashboard.
2. Select [Partner Management](https://dashboard.branch.io/ads/partner-management) from the sidebar.
3. Search for Twitter and click **Save and Enable** in the bottom right hand corner.

1. Select **App Only** from the dropdown

    !!! tip "Set Analytics tags"

        It's easier to slice your data in our analytics platform if you properly assign analytics parameters to your link. _Channels_ generally correspond to ad networks, and _Campaigns_ correspond to marketing initiatives that you're launching. For example: _Channel_: "Twitter", _Campaign_: "Summer 2017 Shoe Discounts."

1. Click **Create Link Now**, and you have your tracking link! Take this link and follow the instructions below.

### View your data with People-Based Attribution

The [Ads Analytics Page](https://dashboard.branch.io/ads/analytics) on the Branch dashboard shows the performance of your ad campaigns _across both web and app_. You can view performance over time, including purchase and other custom events.

Events are attributed using Branch's unified last-click attribution model. This means that Branch will attribute to the last click across channels, and across platforms.

For example, if a customer clicks a Branch email link, and then clicks an ad, installs the the app and purchases an item, Branch will attribute the install and the purchase to the last clicked ad link.

If the customer then goes on to purchase an item on web within the attribution window, Branch will also attribute the web purchase to the same ad link, connecting the web and app actions taken by a single user for a more accurate view of your marketing channels and customer behavior.
