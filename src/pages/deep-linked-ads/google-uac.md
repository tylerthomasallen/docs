# Google Universal App Campaigns

## Overview

If you're running Google's new Universal App Campaign, Branch links can be placed inside your ads. This allows you to track ad-driven installs across Android and iOS on the Branch dashboard and deep link those new users directly to content the first time they open your app.

Branch uses Google Adwords' server to server [App Conversion Confirmation](https://developers.google.com/app-conversion-tracking/api/legacy/confirm) for attribution data which reports on conversion events. Therefore, we only collect **install (conversion) data**. Click data is not supported for this campaign type.

!!! warning "Newer AdWords user interface not supported"
    If you're using the new AdWords experience, you will need to switch back to the old experience to create Universal App Campaigns. Once the campaign is created, you can switch back to the new AdWords experience. We're currently building support for our new style of AdWords integration.

## Setup

Universal App Campaigns don’t use traditional ads and ad groups. Instead different types of ad units are automatically created by Google using information given at the campaign level. There are no destination URLs, you will just use your Apple App Store or Google Play Store Applications.

!!! warning "Prerequisites"
	* [x] To track installs from Google Ads you should integrate the Branch SDK into your app.
	* [x] If you want to deep link from your ads directly to content, you should configure deep link routing.
	* [x] Ads is a premium product priced on Monthly Active Users. Sign up for the Ads product to enable this functionality.

#### Enable Google as an ad partner

Set up Google as an Ad Partner and conversion tracking from Adwords on the Branch dashboard. If you already have Google enabled as an ad partner, follow the conversion tracking steps to ensure the conversion ID and label parameters are setup.

- Navigate to the [Partner Management tab](https://dashboard.branch.io/ads/partner-management){:target="\_blank"}.

![Ads Partner Management](/img/ingredients/deep-linked-ads/enable-google-ad-partner/ads-partner-management.png)

- Search for **Google AdWords**.

!!! tip "Universal App Campaigns for both Android & iOS"
	If you're running a Universal App Campaign for both iOS and Android, all four fields under your Adwords Partner Settings should be populated, even if you have the same conversion ID and Label for iOS and Android. If you want to stop running Universal App Campaign reporting for a platform, just remove the two fields for that platform.

#### Create an Ad Link

1. Create a Branch Ad link from the [Partner Management page](https://dashboard.branch.io/ads/partner-management){:target="\_blank"}'s `Create Google Adwords Link` button under the Google Adwords Partner and select `App Install or Engagement`
<img src="/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/reusable-images/create-link-install-engagement.png" alt="Link Creation" class="three-quarters center">
1. Under the Define Section, pick a Link Name for later reference
1. Configure the link with the Ad Format set to **App Only**, the Ad Partner set to **Google Adwords**, and the Secondary Ad Format set to **Universal App Campaign iOS/Android**.
![Create Ad Link](/img/pages/deep-linked-ads/google-uac/ad-link-setup.png)
1. Under the Analytics Tags sub section additional tags can be set. It is recommended to fill in these fields as they can be used as filters in Branch's Ads Analytics view. To best connect your ad link with your Adwords Campaign, set the channel field to Google Adwords and set the campaign field to the same ad campaign name used in Adwords.

## Troubleshooting

#### FAQ / Debugging

**Q: I'm not seeing any click data for my campaign.**

**A:** Branch uses Google Adwords' server to server [App Conversion Confirmation](https://developers.google.com/app-conversion-tracking/api/legacy/confirm){:target="\_blank"} for attribution data which reports on conversion events. Therefore, we only collect **install (conversion) data**. Click data is not supported for this campaign type.

**Q: I'm getting discrepancy between conversion counts in Branch and Google Adwords**

**A:** While we should always expect around a 5% discrepancy due to time zone differences and the like, if you are seeing significant discrepancies, it could be an indication of a broader problem.

**Q: There's an issue with iOS 10 and Limit Ad Tracking**

**A:** In iOS 10, Apple broke the ability for app developers to collect the `IDFA` if the user had enabled `Limit Ad Tracking`. In this case, Branch and Google cannot compare notes to see who drove the install. This will account for about 15% discrepancy in counts across both platforms, where Branch's tracked installs will be lower.

**Q: I'm not seeing any data coming through for the Universal App Campaign?**

**A:** If you see absolutely 0 data coming through from your integration, it's possible that you're not collecting Google Advertising ID (GAID) on Android or IDFA on iOS.

- iOS: Add the AdSupport.framework.
- Android: Add Google Play Services so that we can collect GAID.

**Q: There seems to be a discrepancy between the Install and Opens values?**

**A:** One discrepancy root cause we've seen before is the scenario where Branch will classify an install as an 'open'. We remember the history of a particular user via their IDFA (in addition to using a few other methods) and will detect whether the user is actually a new user or a returning user who had previously uninstalled your app. Facebook doesn't do this.

We've seen Google classify 're-installs' as fresh installs, where Branch will correctly classify them as 're-opens'. If you're comparing the raw install numbers on Branch, and ignoring the 're-opens', it's possible you'll see a discrepancy. To check sum up the 'installs' and 'reopens' for the given link and compare it to Google's total installs.

If it's close, you know that this is the root cause.

**Q: Fewer Clicks Recorded in Branch**

**A:** The number of clicks on a link used inside of a Branch enabled Facebook Ad will be lower in Branch's dashboard than Google's. This is because Google routes users straight to the App/Play Store without letting Branch know that a link was clicked. If the user decides not to install the app/drops off at the App/Play Store, then Google will have recorded one more click than Branch. Branch does not increment the link's click count until the user enters into the app. This is why you'll see more clicks in Google's dashboard.
