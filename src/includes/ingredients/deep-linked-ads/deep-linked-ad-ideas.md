!!! summary "Ideas for deep linked ads"
	* A user clicks on an ad for 20% off all purchases before the end of the week, and upon opening the app sees the coupon and has it automatically added to the shopping cart.
	* A user clicks on an ad for blue sneakers. You show him the blue sneakers as soon as he opens the app.
	* You know that users clicking on your ads are already familiar with your product. So in your app you reduce the carousel shown to new users from 5 to 2 if they've come in through an ad.
