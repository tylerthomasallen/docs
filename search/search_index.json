However, it\u2019s still beneficial to the matching accuracy, so we recommend employing it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using a custom domain, add a \nbranch_app_domain\n string key in your Info.plist with your custom domain\nto enable 100% matching.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, cookie-based matching is enabled on iOS 9 and 10 if the \nSafariServices.framework\n\nis included in an app's dependencies, and the app uses an app.link subdomain or sets the \nbranch_app_domain\n\nin the Info.plist.

For example, clicking from Facebook, Gmail or Chrome won\u2019t trigger a 100% match here. However, it\u2019s still beneficial to the matching accuracy, so we recommend employing it.

If the Activity exists in the background, every subsequent intent to the Activity just brings it to the foreground.

Once the app is installed, the context is preserved and the user's first app-open will have the deep link data from the original Branch link. To test this, uninstall the app from your device, click the Branch link, and manually launch the app from Android Studio.

Inconsistent Universal links behavior on iOS 11.2  After updating a device to iOS 11.2, we found that the app's AASA file is no longer downloaded reliably onto your user\u2019s device after an app install. As a result, clicking on Universal links will no longer open the app consistenly. You can set  forced uri redirect mode  on your Branch links to open the app with URI schemes. View details of the issue on the  Apple Bug report .    These instructions apply to any integration below mParticle SDK version 7  mParticle introduced a new attribution   deep linking API in v7 of their SDK ( http://docs.mparticle.com/developers/sdk/ios/getting-started/#upgrade-to-version-7-of-the-sdk ), so please contact your Branch or mParticle Account Managers for more details, if you have mParticle SDK v7+ installed in your app.",

The purpose of \ngetLatestReferringParams\n is to\nretrieve those parameters one time. The promise will only return one result. It will not continue\nto return results when links are opened or wait for a link to be opened. This method is not intended\nto notify the app when a link has been opened.\n\n\nTo receive notification whenever a link is opened, \nincluding at app launch\n, call\n\nbranch.subscribe\n. The callback to this method will return any initial link that launched the\napp and all subsequent link opens. There is no need to call \ngetLatestReferringParams\n at app\nlaunch to check for an initial link. Use \nbranch.subscribe\n to handle all link opens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon build problems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to follow the instructions to \nUpdate from \n 2.0.0\n if your\n    app used an earlier version of react-native-branch. In version 2.x, the native SDKs are embedded\n    in the NPM module and must not also be added from elsewhere (Gradle, CocoaPods, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that when using the \nReact\n pod in a native app, the name of the native SDK pod is \nBranch-SDK\n,\n    not \nBranch\n, and it comes from \nnode_modules\n, not the CocoaPods repo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting with React Native 0.40, all external iOS headers in Objective-C must be imported as\n    \n#import \nPackageName/Header.h\n.\n    This applies to React Native headers as well as the \nreact-native-branch/RNBranch.h\n header\n    from this SDK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you upgraded from RN \n 0.40 manually, without adjusting your Xcode project settings, you may\n    still be importing headers with double quotes. This probably indicates a problem with your settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nreact-native-git-upgrade\n tool from NPM may be used to update dependencies as well as project\n    settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Android, when using Proguard in release builds, depending on your build settings, it may be\n    necessary to add one or both of these lines to your \nandroid/app/proguard-rules.pro\n file:\n\n\n-dontwarn com.crashlytics.android.answers.shim.**\n-dontwarn com.google.firebase.appindexing.**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral troubleshooting\n\n\nSee the troubleshooting guide for each native SDK:\n\n\n\n\niOS\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample apps\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nTutorial",

requires ARC, and we don\u2019t intend to add checks thoughout the SDK to try and support pre-ARC.\nHowever, you can add flags to the project to compile the Branch files with ARC. If you wish to do this\nadd \n-fobjc-arc\n to all Branch files.\n\n\n\n\nNote: we by default have this flag checked, but please check before building for iOS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndroid - Using your own Custom Application Class\n\n\nIf you are using your own Custom Application class, you will need to add Branch android library into your project and call the following in method OnCreate():\n\n\nBranch\n.\ngetAutoInstance\n(\nthis\n.\ngetApplicationContext\n());\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using your own custom Activity class, please make sure that you are overridding the following Activities:\n\n\n@Override\n\n\npublic\n \nvoid\n \nonCreate\n(\nBundle\n \nsavedInstanceState\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nsuper\n.\nonCreate\n(\nsavedInstanceState\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n@Override\n\n\npublic\n \nvoid\n \nonNewIntent\n(\nIntent\n \nintent\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nthis\n.\nsetIntent\n(\nintent\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport Branch with different Plugins\n\n\nThe Branch SDK has its own custom \nactivity\n and \napplication\n class. Other plugins that use their own\ncustom activity and application classes can cause \"conflicts\" between these classes. To resolve these conflicts:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a empty android library\n\n\nAdd the Branch plugin along with the other plugins into your project\n\n\nCreate a custom Activity and Application class that will contain the custom logic for all your plugins\n\n\nBuild your library\n\n\nAdd your library into Unity project\n\n\nChange android:name to name of your custom Application class in the \napplication\n tag of your Manifest\n\n\nChange android:name to name of your custom Activity class in the \nactivity\n tag of your Manifest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport several IMPL_APP_CONTROLLER_SUBCLASS\n\n\nThe Branch Unity SDK plugin uses its own UnityAppController that expands default AppController. This is used to catch Universal Links.\n\n\n@interface\n \nBranchAppController\n \n:\n \nUnityAppController\n\n\n{\n\n\n}\n\n\n@end\n\n\n\n@implementation\n \nBranchAppController\n\n\n\n-\n \n(\nBOOL\n)\napplication\n:(\nUIApplication\n \n*)\napplication\n \ncontinueUserActivity\n:(\nNSUserActivity\n \n*)\nuserActivity\n \nrestorationHandler\n:(\nvoid\n \n(^)(\nNSArray\n \n*))\nrestorationHandler\n \n{\n\n    \nBOOL\n \nhandledByBranch\n \n=\n \n[[\nBranchUnityWrapper\n \nsharedInstance\n]\n \ncontinueUserActivity\n:\nuserActivity\n];\n\n    \nreturn\n \nhandledByBranch\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n@end\n\n\n\nIMPL_APP_CONTROLLER_SUBCLASS\n(\nBranchAppController\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nSome Plugins expand the default AppController the same was as Branch does like Cardboard SDK plugin. To resolve conflicts:\n\n\n\n\nMerge all custom AppControllers in one.\n\n\nComment code in other AppControllers (or delete other AppControllers).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample app\n\n\n\n\nBranch Testbed app\n\n\nCode Samples\n for resolving conflicts with other 3rd party plugins",

Be sure to disable this before deploying to production. Note that enabling Debug Mode on Android also forces the app to use the Branch  Test  key if this key has been added to the project. Apps running with a  Test  key will be unable to receive data from Branch links created with the  Live  key.    io.branch.sdk.BranchKey  The app's Branch key. Both a  Live  key and a  Test  key can be added to the Strings.xml file. When  Test  Mode is enabled the app will automatically use the  Test  key, if one has been specified.

If you're unsure of your Branch-assigned app.link subdomain, contact \n, and we can provide it.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced\n\n\nApps/browsers that support Universal Links\n\n\nUnfortunately Universal Links don't work everywhere yet. We have compiled the Universal Links support status of some of the more popular apps.\n\n\nApps that always work\n\n\nIf you open a Universal Link in one of these apps, it should work correctly all the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp/Browser\n\n\nStatus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMessages\n\n\nworks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMail\n\n\nworks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatsApp\n\n\nworks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGmail\n\n\nworks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInbox\n\n\nworks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApps limited by Apple\n\n\nApple has limited Universal Links in certain situations, apparently to avoid confusing users:\n\n\n\n\nUniversal Links will not work if you paste the link into the browser URL field.\n\n\nUniversal Links work with a user driven \na href=\"...\"\n element click \nacross domains\n. Example: if there is a Universal Link on google.com pointing to bnc.lt, it will open the app.\n\n\nUniversal Links will not work with a user driven \na href=\"...\"\n element click on the \nsame domain\n. Example: if there is a Universal Link on google.com pointing to a different Universal Link on google.com, it will not open the app.\n\n\nUniversal Links cannot be triggered via Javascript (in \nwindow.onload\n or via a \n.click()\n call on an \na\n element), unless it is part of a user action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp/Browser\n\n\nStatus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSafari\n\n\nworks conditionally\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChrome\n\n\nworks conditionally\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApps that work sometimes\n\n\nApps with built-in webviews (Google, Twitter, Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WeChat, etc.) work with Universal Links only when a webview is already open. In other words, Universal Links do not work in-app from the feed or main app views.\n\n\nTo work around this limitation, your links must have \ndeepviews\n or something similar enabled, with a call-to-action link/button that has a Universal Link behind it. This way, clicking a link from the app feed will open a webview containing your deepview page, and the user can then click the link/button to launch your app. All of Apple's limitations (in the section above) still apply for the deepview page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp/Browser\n\n\nStatus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle\n\n\nworks conditionally\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\nworks conditionally\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Messenger\n\n\nworks conditionally\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeChat\n\n\nworks conditionally\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\nworks conditionally\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\nworks conditionally\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny app using \nSFSafariViewController\n\n\nworks conditionally\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApps with special cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp/Browser\n\n\nStatus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlack\n\n\nworks if configured to open links in Safari. Otherwise, works conditionally as in the above section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApps that do not work\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp/Browser\n\n\nStatus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPinterest\n\n\nbroken\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\n\nbroken\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTelegram\n\n\nbroken\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon issues that cause Universal Links to fail\n\n\n\n\nAutomated Validation for Your Xcode Project\n\n\nYou can check if your Xcode project is correctly configured by using our \nUniversal Links Validator\n.\n\n\n\n\nAre you testing by manually entering into Safari?\n\n\nUniversal Links don't work properly when entered into Safari. Use Notes or iMessage for testing.\n\n\nAre you wrapping Branch links with another link and redirecting?\n\n\nIn most cases, Universal Links won't open the app when they are \"wrapped\" by click tracking links. Universal links, including Branch links, must be freestanding. If you want Universal Links to work in all situations, do not use other links that redirect to your Branch links.\n\n\nDo your Team ID \n Bundle ID match those on your dashboard?\n\n\nYou can find them in the Dashboard under Settings \n Link Settings, in the iOS section next to \"Enable Universal Links.\" They should match your Team ID and Bundle ID. Team ID can be found here \nhttps://developer.apple.com/membercenter/index.action#accountSummary\n. Your Bundle ID is found in Xcode, in the \nGeneral\n tab for the correct build target. If your Apple App Prefix is different from your Team ID, you should use your App Prefix. Your app prefix can be found from App IDs on Apple's Developer Portal.\n\n\nHave you deleted the app and reinstalled it?\n\n\niOS does not re-scrape the apple-app-site-association file unless you delete and reinstall the app. (The only exception to this is App Store updates. iOS does rescrape on every update. This means that when users update to a version of your app with the applinks entitlement, Universal Links will start working for them.)\n\n\nUniversal Links can be disabled, unfortunately.\n\n\nIf you are successfully taken into your app via a Universal Link, you'll see \"app.link\" (or your domain) and a forward button in the top right corner of the status bar.

Below are some examples from iOS and Android where we're using the \npictureId\n key to route, but you can see more code snippets for \nthe other platforms here\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\niOS - Objective C\n\n\n-\n \n(\nBOOL\n)\napplication:\n(\nUIApplication\n \n*\n)\napplication\n \ndidFinishLaunchingWithOptions:\n(\nNSDictionary\n \n*\n)\nlaunchOptions\n \n{\n\n\n  \n// initialize the session, setup a deep link handler\n\n  \n[[\nBranch\n \ngetInstance\n]\n \ninitSessionWithLaunchOptions\n:\nlaunchOptions\n\n                          \nandRegisterDeepLinkHandler\n:\n^\n(\nNSDictionary\n \n*\nparams\n,\n \nNSError\n \n*\nerror\n)\n \n{\n\n\n    \n// start setting up the view controller hierarchy\n\n    \nUINavigationController\n \n*\nnavC\n \n=\n \n(\nUINavigationController\n \n*\n)\nself\n.\nwindow\n.\nrootViewController\n;\n\n    \nUIStoryboard\n \n*\nstoryboard\n \n=\n \n[\nUIStoryboard\n \nstoryboardWithName\n:\n@\nMain\n \nbundle\n:\nnil\n];\n\n    \nUIViewController\n \n*\nnextVC\n;\n\n\n    \n// If the key \npictureId\n is present in the deep link dictionary\n\n    \n// then load the picture screen with the appropriate picture\n\n    \nNSString\n \n*\npictureId\n \n=\n \n[\nparams\n \nobjectForKey\n:\n@\npictureId\n];\n\n    \nif\n \n(\npictureId\n)\n \n{\n\n      \nnextVC\n \n=\n \n[\nstoryboard\n \ninstantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier\n:\n@\nPicVC\n];\n\n      \n[\nnextVC\n \nsetNextPictureId\n:\npictureId\n];\n\n    \n}\n \nelse\n \n{\n\n      \nnextVC\n \n=\n \n[\nstoryboard\n \ninstantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier\n:\n@\nMainVC\n];\n\n    \n}\n\n\n    \n// navigate!\n\n    \n[\nnavC\n \nsetViewControllers\n:\n@[\nnextVC\n]\n \nanimated\n:\nYES\n];\n\n  \n}];\n\n\n  \nreturn\n \nYES\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niOS - Swift\n\n\nfunc\n \napplication\n(\n_\n \napplication\n:\n \nUIApplication\n,\n \ndidFinishLaunchingWithOptions\n \nlaunchOptions\n:\n \n[\nUIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey\n:\n \nAny\n]?)\n \n-\n \nBool\n \n{\n\n    \nlet\n \nbranch\n:\n \nBranch\n \n=\n \nBranch\n.\ngetInstance\n()\n\n        \nbranch\n.\ninitSession\n(\nlaunchOptions\n:\n \nlaunchOptions\n,\n \nandRegisterDeepLinkHandler\n:\n \n{\nparams\n,\n \nerror\n \nin\n\n        \n// If the key \npictureId\n is present in the deep link dictionary\n\n        \nif\n \nerror\n \n==\n \nnil\n \n \nparams\n[\n+clicked_branch_link\n]\n \n!=\n \nnil\n \n \nparams\n[\npictureId\n]\n \n!=\n \nnil\n \n{\n\n            \nprint\n(\nclicked picture link!\n)\n\n            \n// load the view to show the picture\n\n        \n}\n \nelse\n \n{\n\n            \n// load your normal view\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n})\n\n    \nreturn\n \ntrue\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\n@Override\n\n\npublic\n \nvoid\n \nonStart\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nsuper\n.\nonStart\n();\n\n\n    \nBranch\n \nbranch\n \n=\n \nBranch\n.\ngetInstance\n();\n\n\n    \nbranch\n.\ninitSession\n(\nnew\n \nBranchReferralInitListener\n(){\n\n        \n@Override\n\n        \npublic\n \nvoid\n \nonInitFinished\n(\nJSONObject\n \nreferringParams\n,\n \nBranch\n.\nBranchError\n \nerror\n)\n \n{\n\n            \nif\n \n(\nerror\n \n==\n \nnull\n)\n \n{\n\n                \n// params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked before showing up\n\n                \n// params will be empty if no data found\n\n                \nString\n \npictureID\n \n=\n \nreferringParams\n.\noptString\n(\npicture_id\n,\n \n);\n\n                \nif\n \n(\npictureID\n.\nequals\n(\n))\n \n{\n\n                    \nstartActivity\n(\nnew\n \nIntent\n(\nthis\n,\n \nHomeActivity\n.\nclass\n));\n\n                \n}\n\n                \nelse\n \n{\n\n                    \nIntent\n \ni\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nIntent\n(\nthis\n,\n \nViewerActivity\n.\nclass\n);\n\n                    \ni\n.\nputExtra\n(\npicture_id\n,\n \npictureID\n);\n\n                    \nstartActivity\n(\ni\n);\n\n                \n}\n\n            \n}\n \nelse\n \n{\n\n                \nLog\n.\ne\n(\nMyApp\n,\n \nerror\n.\ngetMessage\n());\n\n            \n}\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n},\n \nthis\n.\ngetIntent\n().\ngetData\n(),\n \nthis\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch-added parameters\n\n\nIn addition to any custom key/value pairs specified in the link data dictionary, Branch also returns some other useful parameters every time a session is initialized.

If you populate \n$deeplink_path\n, \n$ios_deeplink_path\n or \n$android_deeplink_path\n with a URI path, you will need to a bit of additional work to ensure that Branch links route according to your original schema.\n\n\n\n\nCall initSession as described in \nthe app configuration steps\n\n\nIn the callback function, add some custom code to read the appropriate \n$deeplink_path\n parameter in the \nparams\n \n\n\nUse this value to call your existing routing logic to route users to the correct place in your app\n\n\n\n\nOption 3: Use Branch's easy config deep link routing\n\n\nAuto-routing in iOS\n\n\nConfigure View Controller to accept deep links\n\n\nOpen the view controller that you want to appear when a user clicks a link.

            "text": "People-Based Attribution\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nBranch is introducing a new and improved analytics platform for you to preview.\n\n\nWhile the most visible impact of this change is our new and visually improved Summary Graph, it is important to understand that we have fundamentally changed the underlying model we use for counting events. This is the result of consistent feedback from Branch partners who have requested we provide deeper insights and clarity around campaigns powered by Branch links. As you want to understand the events associated with clicks on Branch links beyond the course of one user session and across all types of Branch links, we developed a new attribution engine to accurately attribute user events across interaction platforms and across channels.\n\n\nThe biggest change is that we decoupled deep linking and attribution. Now you can measure the impact of events that are not directly associated with the user session in which the click occurred and this means you will now see different numbers on your Branch dashboard.\n\n\nIn some cases, a user may click a link and only open the app several hours or days later. With this new analytics platform, we are still able to attribute both the open and any subsequent events, even though we did not deep link the user.\nAlso and from now on, anytime you analyze data in the Branch dashboard, or export it out, you will see consistency in naming across all our reports and products, for all events.\n\n\nThis document highlights each of the section where you can expect to see differences between our old analytics and new People-Based Attribution.\n\n\n\n\nNo changes required\n\n\nWe've changed the entire back-end of analytics without requiring any code or implementation changes on your end.\n\n\n\n\nData Mapping\n\n\nFrom now, Branch provides you a well defined standard to keep track of and categorize events.\n\n\nThis is different than previous behavior from when you integrated the Branch SDK. Once you created and clicked links, we automatically tracked clicks, installs, opens, and web session starts and pageviews (if you installed the web SDK). If you enabled Deepviews or Journeys, we counted clicks when a click didn't actually occur, such as when a Deepview displayed, a Journey automatically opened the app without any physical click. This caused confusion on our dashboard, as users would noticed clicks occurring without anyone ever clicking a link! Fortunately, thanks to a well-defined standard and categorization of events, this will no longer be the case.\n\n\nBelow is the new classification of events. Think of when you track when a user adds payment info, and initiates a purchase, and finally completes a purchase: those are all \ncommerce\n events. Similarly, we now have \ncontent\n events and \nuser lifecycle\n events.\n\n\n\n\nimpression\n\n\nclick\n\n\nBranch CTA view\n\n\nweb to app auto redirect\n\n\nSMS sent\n\n\ninstall\n\n\nopen\n\n\nreinstall\n\n\npageview\n\n\nweb session start\n\n\ncommerce event\n\n\ncontent event\n\n\nuser lifecycle event\n\n\ncustom event\n\n\n\n\nWhat's changed?\n\n\nDeep Linking\n\n\nThe biggest change is the analytics associated with deep linking. Previously, when a user clicked your Branch links, and installed within a two hour window, they were deep linked \nand\n attributed. This means that their first time experience included your deep linked data, and we counted an install. If they installed four hours after clicking instead of two, they would not receive deep link data, and we would \nnot\n attribute this user's install.\n\n\nNow, we've separated this concept. Deep linking windows remain two hours, but attribution windows are adjustable. Going with the previous example, if someone clicks your link, and installs the app after 4 hours, they will \nnot\n receive deep link data, but will be counted as an install.\n\n\nNote: no code changes are needed, and if you want to change the deep linking window, you can do so. Read the \nattribution window\n section for more information.\n\n\nAttribution Windows\n\n\nNow that deep linking and attribution analytics are separate, we have attribution windows for analytics. As a reminder, an attribution window simply defines the window of time for  when an eligible attribution or deep link can occur. In order to make changes, navigate to the \nlink settings\n page, and scroll down to \"Attribution Window\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep Linking Duration\n refers to the duration of time someone is eligible to receive deep link data. This includes anyone clicking a Branch link, or being automatically redirected to the app through a Branch Web SDK call. Measured in minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to x\n refers to events that occur after someone clicks a Branch link. If someone clicks and installs from a link, and comes back 10 days later to purchase, we would count that as a conversion, and it would surface in our dashboard. Measured in days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpression to x\n refers to events that occur after someone views a Branch impression link. Measured in days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the default value of 2 hours for deep linking and attribution under the old system, and 2 hours for deep linking with 7 days for install attribution, here's what you can expect.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnique behavior\n\n\nWe now default every visualization in the dashboard to be unique. This means that if you are testing Branch links, and click a link 5 times, we will display that as one click. This applies to events as well. This applies to all events, as well.\n\n\nSelect visualizations also allow you to see total (i.e. non-unique) numbers as well. If you'd like to see total numbers on a visualization that does not support it, you can also export raw data.\n\n\nCutoff date\n\n\nAs far as the deployment of People-Based Attribution, we created our cut off date on October 14th 2017 and we kept the old and new analytical systems running in parallel since then and will continue to do this for a short while. This mean you can query data from any time before October 14th up until October 14th with old analytics. You can query data from October 14th onwards with both analytics. But if you wanted to do reports across this line, say, October 13th to October 15th, you would need two separate queries.\n\n\nDifferences From Cutoff Date\n\n\nIf you are tracking Purchase events, and want to see unique values for Purchases before the cut off date of October 14th 2017, those values will display as 0. This is because the Purchase event hasn't stored unique counts before October 14th. However, we are now storing this information since then.\n\n\nChanges to the Branch Dashboard\n\n\nBranch Summary Analytics\n\n\nThis section covers the changes found on the main page of the Branch \ndashboard\n.  \n\n\nInstall Summary Section\n\n\nThis is the first chart found on the main page. This chart surfaces install counts for your app using the new People-Based Analytics.\n\n\n\n\nold\n\n\n\n\nnew\n\n\nChanges\n\n\nWe've removed the pie chart from the old visualizations; this is simply removing a chart, not removing any data. You can see the same breakdowns by campaign, channel, etc on the new install summary chart, making the pie chart redundant. (See also this article on why \npie charts\n are misleading.)\n\n\nThis new install summary chart by default shows Branch only installs, that are powered by the new attribution \nwindows\n. If you want to see all installs, and not just Branch driven installs, simply click \nShow All Installs\n. You will likely notice a higher number of installs driven by Branch--this is because we have a bigger window to count an install.\n\n\nFiltering is improved on this chart, as you can add additional query logic by clicking \nAdd Compare\n and \nAdd Filter\n. Previously, you could only filter by one dimension, and now you can filter with more dimensions, with more comparisons.\n\n\nClick Flow Section\n\n\nThis section is visually the same, but different in terms of \nhow\n clicks are tracked. First, we only track unique person clicks, so if you click the same link on your device 5 times, this chart will only reflect one click. Mobile deepview views or SMS sents do not count as clicks in this chart.\n\n\nQuick Link Analytics\n\n\nJust like click flow analytics, this section is visually the same, but clicks are tracked differently. These clicks are tracked by unique counts, and follow the model where only a click is counted when someone physically taps a link. Mobile deepview views or SMS sents do not count as clicks in this chart. The data can be exported.\n\n\nSource Analytics\n\n\nVisually, you will see the query selector that is present on Install Summary. This is the same component, and it will let you drill down and add filtering logic across all events, not just installs. This data is unique as well, and can be exported.\n\n\nJourneys\n\n\nJourneys data has also changed substantially. Previously, Journeys only included paid Journeys. Now it includes all of our Web SDK's web-to-app offerings. So it also includes analytics from the .banner() and .deepview() functions.\n\n\nUniversal Ads\n\n\nUniversal Ads were introduced using the new People-Based Analytics platform, so there is no expected change. The data is unique as well, and can be exported.\n\n\nChanges to exported data\n\n\nLiveview\n\n\nLiveview hasn't changed much, but we've introduced an improved CSV export that reflects these new data models.\n\n\nData Integrations\n\n\nData Integrations now mirrors the UI of our ads flow. The data we send is also utilizing the new mechanism of attribution, meaning we will send data within a proper attribution window instead of the same session. This means more of your attributed data will make it across automatically.\n\n\nWebhooks\n\n\nWebhooks, like data integratons, is no longer session based. This means we will send more webhooks to you automatically. This update hasn't completed yet.\n\n\nChanges to Install, Re-installs, and Opens\n\n\nPrior to the rollout of People-Based Attribution, Branch classified \u201cre-installs\u201d as opens. With People-Based Attribution, we now split out re-installs from opens. As a result, we can show you installs vs reinstalls vs opens.\n\n\nOur SDK uses an identifier, which we persist between app opens, to know whether the app was previously installed. This identifier is for internal use only. When an app is first installed, this identifier is not yet stored on the device. Then our SDK makes a request to our install endpoint. On our backend, Branch determines whether this is an install, a reinstall, or in some cases, an open. Then it returns this identifier. The SDK persists this identifier, and all future requests will be made to our servers with it present.\n\n\nOverall, how does Branch determine whether an app open is an install, reinstall, or open?\n\n\nWhen Branch first launched, every partner who integrated the Branch SDK saw Branch measure an artificially high number of installs. As an example, if a user had an app installed on their phone before without the Branch SDK, and then upgraded to a version of the app that had the Branch SDK, Branch would count this upgrade as an install, even though the user had the app previously. Branch attempted to solve for this use case.\n\n\nBranch introduced a field to the SDK, called \u201cupdate\u201d, which used complex, OS-specific logic. The SDK indicated, based on either OS-provided methods or traces left by the file system, whether this particular install or open was actually just an update. In other words, the app was already installed, but the user just updated what version of the app they had. If the SDK indicated that for this particular app session, the app was updated, we would not count an install, but rather an open.\n\n\nNow, how does Branch translate this update, within the context of installs, opens, and reinstalls?\n\n\nIf we see the flag \u201cupdate\u201d sent by the SDK set to \u201cfresh install\u201d (this is set to an enum value of \n0\n in our SDK logs), then we know that the user was not updating the app. In this case, it\u2019s either an install or a reinstall. Given this information, our backend must decide between install and reinstall. Our backend performs a lookup to our People Based Attribution database and finds whether this device, using the device identifier, ever had the app installed. If so, we count this as a re-install, instead of an install. If the app was never installed on this device, we track an install.\n\n\nIf we see the flag \u201cupdate\u201d sent by the SDK set to \u201cjust updated\u201d (this is an enum value of \n2\n in our SDK logs), then we know that the user updated the app, as opposed to freshly installing. This event is not tracked as an install. This event is tracked as an open.\n\n\nWith the introduction and adoption of iOS 11, we uncovered an intermittent issue with install tracking. It appears that on newer versions of the OS, app installs have been inconsistently counted as opens rather than fresh installs. The logic causing this was intended to detect when apps had been installed on a device prior to the Branch SDK being integrated and to register opens instead of installs, as described above. However, as more devices have updated to newer versions of iOS, install discrepancies have increased and we believe this logic is the cause. In response, we have removed this logic.\n\n\nThe resultant impact for apps using Branch for over three months is that installs should increase to reflect correct numbers, starting January 5th. There should be no adverse impact. Partners who have newly integrated the Branch SDK will notice a large spike of installs when first releasing the SDK but no impact beyond that.\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\nData Speed\n\n\nThis new People-Based Analytics platform introduces a slight delay compared to the old dashboard analytics, and it may now take a few minutes for events to appear. We're continually improving the speed and plan to significantly decrease the delay in Q1 2018.\n\n\nUnique Counts\n\n\nOne thing to be aware of is that unique counts may be within a 4% window of error across the dashboard. For example, if you have 100 total clicks, and 90 were truly unique, it's possible that the dashboard could report within 4% of that 90 number. If you want true uniques, you can export raw data and de-dupe across events.\n\n\nOne consequence of this is that if you compare by different dimensions and sum the results, the total may not add up. As an example, if you compare all attributed installs by campaign and by channel (careful: be sure to include where the install is attributed and campaign/channel is null), then the totals may not line up. They should be nearly identical, varying \nat most\n by 4%. \n\n\nDiffering Installs\n\n\nAs part of People-Based Attribution, your install numbers will likely not line up one to one. What this means is that if you see 200 Branch driven installs on the old Analytics Platform, it's ok to see 190 Branch driven installs (or even 210) on the same day. This is due to the way we have fundamentally changed the way we count attributions.\n\n\nSome installs on the old analytics platform were actually \"reinstalls\", but were not counted as such, which would be one reason why installs are lower. Some campaigns will count higher installs, because they may be clicked on a variety of browsers and platforms, and Branch is able to connect those touch points to accurately count an install.\n\n\nIf the difference in numbers is still concerning, reach out to your Branch account manager, or send us a message at \n\n\nNew Dashboard Accounts\n\n\nAccounts created on or after December 15th, 2017 (UTC time zone) will run exclusively on the People-Based Attribution platform.\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDiscrepancies\n\n\nSDK Version\n\n\nWhile different install numbers are to be expected, there may be some discrepancies not related to the new attribution platform counting methodologies. You may notice numbers are off if you are on version 0.12.4 or below on the iOS SDK. If that is the case, please upgrade to the latest version of the SDK, or at least 0.12.5. There is no cut off for Android.",

            "text": "Prior to the rollout of People-Based Attribution, Branch classified \u201cre-installs\u201d as opens. With People-Based Attribution, we now split out re-installs from opens. As a result, we can show you installs vs reinstalls vs opens.  Our SDK uses an identifier, which we persist between app opens, to know whether the app was previously installed. This identifier is for internal use only. When an app is first installed, this identifier is not yet stored on the device. Then our SDK makes a request to our install endpoint. On our backend, Branch determines whether this is an install, a reinstall, or in some cases, an open. Then it returns this identifier. The SDK persists this identifier, and all future requests will be made to our servers with it present.  Overall, how does Branch determine whether an app open is an install, reinstall, or open?  When Branch first launched, every partner who integrated the Branch SDK saw Branch measure an artificially high number of installs. As an example, if a user had an app installed on their phone before without the Branch SDK, and then upgraded to a version of the app that had the Branch SDK, Branch would count this upgrade as an install, even though the user had the app previously. Branch attempted to solve for this use case.  Branch introduced a field to the SDK, called \u201cupdate\u201d, which used complex, OS-specific logic. The SDK indicated, based on either OS-provided methods or traces left by the file system, whether this particular install or open was actually just an update. In other words, the app was already installed, but the user just updated what version of the app they had. If the SDK indicated that for this particular app session, the app was updated, we would not count an install, but rather an open.  Now, how does Branch translate this update, within the context of installs, opens, and reinstalls?  If we see the flag \u201cupdate\u201d sent by the SDK set to \u201cfresh install\u201d (this is set to an enum value of  0  in our SDK logs), then we know that the user was not updating the app. In this case, it\u2019s either an install or a reinstall. Given this information, our backend must decide between install and reinstall. Our backend performs a lookup to our People Based Attribution database and finds whether this device, using the device identifier, ever had the app installed. If so, we count this as a re-install, instead of an install. If the app was never installed on this device, we track an install.  If we see the flag \u201cupdate\u201d sent by the SDK set to \u201cjust updated\u201d (this is an enum value of  2  in our SDK logs), then we know that the user updated the app, as opposed to freshly installing. This event is not tracked as an install. This event is tracked as an open.  With the introduction and adoption of iOS 11, we uncovered an intermittent issue with install tracking. It appears that on newer versions of the OS, app installs have been inconsistently counted as opens rather than fresh installs. The logic causing this was intended to detect when apps had been installed on a device prior to the Branch SDK being integrated and to register opens instead of installs, as described above. However, as more devices have updated to newer versions of iOS, install discrepancies have increased and we believe this logic is the cause. In response, we have removed this logic.  The resultant impact for apps using Branch for over three months is that installs should increase to reflect correct numbers, starting January 5th. There should be no adverse impact. Partners who have newly integrated the Branch SDK will notice a large spike of installs when first releasing the SDK but no impact beyond that.",

For example, if you have 100 total clicks, and 90 were truly unique, it's possible that the dashboard could report within 4% of that 90 number. If you want true uniques, you can export raw data and de-dupe across events.  One consequence of this is that if you compare by different dimensions and sum the results, the total may not add up. As an example, if you compare all attributed installs by campaign and by channel (careful: be sure to include where the install is attributed and campaign/channel is null), then the totals may not line up. They should be nearly identical, varying  at most  by 4%.",

This is due to the way we have fundamentally changed the way we count attributions.  Some installs on the old analytics platform were actually \"reinstalls\", but were not counted as such, which would be one reason why installs are lower. Some campaigns will count higher installs, because they may be clicked on a variety of browsers and platforms, and Branch is able to connect those touch points to accurately count an install.

It looks something like \n_branch_view_id=296449069883323397\n. When this parameter is detected, the SDK loads a temporary preview of that specific Journey. This parameter is only valid for your Branch Key, and will not work on any other website even if the Branch SDK is integrated.\n\n\n\n\nValidation\n\n\n\n\nThere are a number of errors and warnings you may encounter.\n\n\nWeb SDK errors\n\n\nYou must have the web SDK installed on your website to run a Journey.\n\n\nApp SDK warnings\n\n\nIf you choose to target iOS or Android users but haven\u2019t integrated those SDKs, your Journeys will still show on the correct devices and direct users to your app. However, you won\u2019t be able to get any install or event attribution for your Journeys, and you will not be able to deep link users to content inside your app. Be sure to integrate the Branch SDK into your app.\n\n\nAudience rule warnings\n\n\nYou will see a warning if your audience rules do not add up to 100%. If less than 100%, the remainder will see whatever is normal behavior for your website. Your Journey will still run.\n\n\nPremium account warnings\n\n\nIf you have built a Journey that includes premium-only functionality, you will see a warning, as certain features are only available by purchasing.\n\n\nManaging your Journeys App Banners\n\n\nThe \nJourneys Manager\n is your homepage for all of the personalized experiences create. You can turn Journeys on and off, clone them, or view performance.\n\n\n\n\nA Journey can have one of four states:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState\n\n\nMeaning\n\n\nNext Stage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraft\n\n\nNot yet published, still editable\n\n\nActive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive\n\n\nLive for your users, read-only\n\n\nStopped\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStopped\n\n\nNot live for your users, read-only\n\n\nActive\n or \nArchived\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchived\n\n\nNot live for your users, hidden from default manager view\n\n\nnone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can activate a journey directly from the creation flow, or from \nStart\n in the Actions menus in the Journeys Manager.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditing a live Journey\n\n\nTo prevent corruption of historical analytics data, Journeys cannot be edited once they leave \nDraft\n status. However, you can \nClone\n a Journey and make changes to the new copy.\n\n\n\n\nPrioritizing Journeys\n\n\nThe Journeys Priority View allows you to set the priority of multiple Journeys when they \noverlap\n. They \noverlap\n when a single person is eligible to see multiple Journeys. You can prioritize the Journey that should show ahead of any others.\n\n\nLet's say you have two Journeys that may reach the same audience.\n\n\n\n\nA half page interstitial that promotes an offer on your \"Shoes\" category page.\n\n\nA smart banner that should show for all visitors.\n\n\n\n\nIn general, you'd like the interstitial to show ahead of the smart banner on the \"Shoes\" category page (where both audience segments overlap).\n\n\nTo prioritize Journeys, switch to the Priority View by clicking on the toggle.\n\n\n\n\nYou're now in Priority View.\n\n\n\n\nDrag and drop Journeys in the order you'd like them to show. The lower numbers mean higher priority (i.e. a Journey with priority 1 is going to show ahead of a Journey with priority 2).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the \nSave\n button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Journeys have now been prioritized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\nWhen you save Journeys priorities, \nALL\n Journeys will be prioritized in the order they appear in the table.\n\n\n\n\nFor more detailed Journeys prioritization questions, visit our \nAdvanced section\n.\n\n\nVisualizing Journeys performance\n\n\nAnalytics \n attribution\n\n\nJourneys map to \nstandard Branch analytics labels\n:\n\n\n\n\nAll Journeys: \nfeature\n = \njourneys\n\n\nEach Journey: \ncampaign\n = \n[Journey Name]\n\n\nIndividual Templates: \ntags\n = \n[Template Name]\n (+ any additional tags you specify during configuration)\n\n\n\n\nYou can access your Journey\u2019s performance by selecting \nView Performance\n from the actions menu in the Journeys Manager.\n\n\n\n\nUsing Source Analytics\n\n\nYou can also access Journeys analytics by selecting the above filters from the \nSource Analytics\n page of the Branch dashboard.\n\n\n\n\nTo compare all of your Journeys\n\n\n\n\nFilter by \nfeature\n = \njourneys\n\n\n\n\nTo compare variations within one Journey\n\n\n\n\nFilter by \nfeature\n = \njourneys\n\n\nFilter by \ncampaign\n = \n[Journey Name]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute Journeys events to referring links\n\n\nBy default, when users arrive on a page running Journeys via a Branch link, then any interaction with the Journey (click/install/re-open) will be attributed to the referring Branch link, rather than to the Journey. \nLearn how\n to attribute this data to the Journey instead.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced\n\n\nAdvanced audience rules\n\n\nYou can target users on a more granular level - based on behavior like where they came from, whether they already have your app installed, and what they\u2019ve done on your website or in your app. We've created a bunch of great examples on the \nnext tab\n.\n\n\n\n\nHas completed event\n\n\nIf you have \ncustom event tracking\n set up, you can target users based on events that you define. For instance, you might want to show a Journey to users who have completed a purchase within the last week, or who add an item to their shopping cart more than three times.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs viewing a page url\n\n\nYou can define which subsets of your website the Journey will appear. For example, maybe you have a page \nyoursite.com/settings\n and \nyoursite.com/products/1234\n. You could fill in \nproducts\n here and only users visiting a URL with that substring present would see the Journey.\n\n\nHas visited web\n\n\nHere, you can use website visits to determine who to target. For instance, you might decide that someone who visits your site five times is ready to see a Journey with some extra incentive to open the app.\n\n\nHas visited the app\n\n\nSimilar to visited web, you can target users by number of app visits. For example, someone who has visited the app two times and opens up the mobile web could be lured back into the app with a Journey.\n\n\nHas the app installed\n\n\nYou might choose to only show a Journey that asks a user to open the app to those that already have it installed.\n\n\nHas clicked on ad\n\n\nA user is grouped into \"Has clicked on Ad\" when they've clicked a link from \nDeep Linked Feeds\n.\n\n\nUse this to target users who have been part of an ad campaign to improve your ROI; maybe with a specific call to action to open the app and buy something if they've also never made a purchase in the app.\n\n\nThe technical definition is that they've clicked on a link with an Ad Network's custom \n$3p\n value in link data, but you just need to consider the way the link is created - in this case, through Deep Linked Feeds.\n\n\nHas clicked on email\n\n\nA user is grouped into \"Has clicked on Email\" when they've clicked a link from \nDeep Linked Email\n.\n\n\nUse this to target users who have been part of an email campaign; maybe with a specific call to action to get them download the app if they don't have it and they've landed on mobile web.\n\n\nThe technical definition is that they've clicked on a link with an Email Service Provider's custom \n$3p\n value in link data, but you just need to consider the way the link is created - in this case, through a Deep Linked Email integration.\n\n\nIs viewing a page with metadata key\n\n\nUse this filter to target users viewing web pages with certain metadata specified. This data can be specified in HTML \nmeta\n tags on a webpage, passed in as options in the \ninit()\n call that you use to initialize the Branch web SDK, or passed in using the \ntrack()\n call in Branch\u2019s web SDK. Note that if you opt to use HTML \nmeta\n tags, your tags should be formatted as \nBranch hosted deep link data\n.\n\n\nFor example, you could target users on pages containing the metadata key \u201cfoo\u201d and value \u201cbar\u201d by adding this tag to the page\u2019s HTML: \nmeta name=\"branch:deeplink:foo\" content=\"bar\" /\n\n\nOr by initializing Branch\u2019s web SDK with the following options object:\n\n\nbranch\n.\ninit\n(\n \nBRANCH_KEY\n,\n\n    \n{\n\n        \nmetadata\n \n:\n \n{\n\n            \nfoo\n \n:\n \nbar\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n}\n\n\n);\n\n\n\n\n\nOr, finally, by using the track() call to \nprogrammatically trigger a Journey to show\n:\n\n\nbranch\n.\ntrack\n(\n\u2018\npageview\n\u2019\n,\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n\u2018\nfoo\n\u2019\n \n:\n \n\u2018\nbar\n\u2019\n\n    \n}\n\n\n);\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce metadata has been specified on a page in any or all of the three locations specified above, you can target users on that page using the \u201cIs viewing a page with metadata key\u201d audience filter. If metadata with the same key has been specified in either \ninit()\n or \ntrack()\n \nand\n in an HTML \nmeta\n tag, the metadata passed into either \ninit()\n or \ntrack()\n will take precedence.\n\n\nSet up split testing\n\n\nNote that if you are planning on just using the free banner, you can skip this section. This feature allows you to run A/B tests by designing multiple templates and assigning a percentage of your audience to each one.\n\n\n\n\nClick the \nAdd Variation\n button to add another design variation. \n\n\nTo remove an unwanted variation, click the \n-\n button. \n\n\nUse the percentage fields to control the ratio of your audience that will see each variation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariation Display Limitations\n\n\nYou may have up to three variations in each Journey. Your total percentage allocation must not equal more than \n100%\n. Your total percentage allocation may be \nless\n than \n100%\n. In this situation, the remainder of your audience will be shown your standard website without a Journey. This allows you to A/B test against your non-Journeys website experience.\n\n\n\n\nAuto-open\n\n\nYou can auto-open the app for users have your app installed with Journeys. You can find this setting by selecting the CTA in the template editor:\n\n\n\n\nWhen this box is checked, if a user views this Journey variation on your website and they have the app installed, the app will automatically open without them clicking.\n\n\n\n\nAs opening the app automatically is the best user experience in most cases, this is checked by default for all new templates. \n\n\n\n\nWeb SDK open app setting\n\n\nIf you use the open_app setting within the web SDK, this setting will still work for old Journeys (older than 10/25). For all new Journeys, the template setting will take precedence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen app behavior in in-app webviews\n\n\nPlease avoid using the Branch Web SDK on webpages inside of native webviews. The Branch Web SDK's auto-open can cause unexpected user experiences.\n\n\n\n\nAuto-open the app on iOS\n\n\nThe auto-open setting in the template editor will work on iOS Chrome and Android. Because auto-open is powered by URI schemes and these can lead to error messages on iOS Safari for users without your app, this is not enabled on iOS by default. \n\n\nIf you would like the app to open automatically on iOS Safari as well, you'll need to use a setting called \n$uri_redirect_mode\n. Since Branch has a massive pool of cookies tied to device identifiers, we know if your app is installed when the user clicks a link. We use this intelligence to determine when to use URI schemes. If we have the history that the user installed your app, we\u2019ll use URI schemes to open up the app. \n\n\nYou can \nreach out to support\n to enable this behavior across all your links, or set it just for Journeys in the web SDK:\n\n\nscript\n \ntype=\ntext/javascript\n\n// load the Branch web lib\n(function(b,r,a,n,c,h,_,s,d,k){if(!b[n]||!b[n]._q){for(;s\n_.length\n;)c(h,_[s++]);\nd=\nr.createElement(a);d.async=1;d.src=\nbuild.min.js\n;k=r.getElementsByTagName(a)[0];k.parentNode.insertBefore(d,k);b[n]=h}})(window,document,\nscript\n,\nbranch\n,function(b,r){b[r]=function(){b._q.push([r,arguments])}},{_q:[],_v:1},\naddListener\n \napplyCode\n \nbanner\n \ncloseBanner\n \ncreditHistory\n \ncredits\n \ndata\n \ndeepview\n \ndeepviewCta\n \nfirst\n \ngetCode\n \ninit\n \nlink\n \nlogout\n \nredeem\n \nreferrals\n \nremoveListener\n \nsendSMS\n \nsetBranchViewData\n \nsetIdentity\n \ntrack\n \nvalidateCode\n.split(\n \n),\n \n0);\n\n\n//\n \ninit\n \nBranch\n \nand\n \npass\n \nin\n \nyour\n \npreference\n \nto\n \nopen\n \nthe\n \napp\n\n\nbranch.init(\nBRANCH_KEY\n);\n\n\n//\n \nTrigger\n \nyour\n \nJourneys\n \nbanner\n \nto\n \nuse\n \nthe\n \ncorrect\n \nredirect\n \nmode\n\n\nbranch.setBranchViewData({\n\n        \n$uri_redirect_mode\n:\n \n1\n\n\n});\n\n\n/script\n\n\n\n\n\nOr, set it for individual templates by adding deep link data \n$uri_redirect_mode:1\n:\n\n\n\n\nRead our blog\n to learn more about the challenges of URI schemes on iOS and the URI redirect mode feature.\n\n\nPreserve or discard referring link data\n\n\nBy default, when users arrive on a page running Journeys via a Branch link and \nmake_new_link\n is not set to \ntrue\n, then any interaction with the Journey (click/install/re-open) will be attributed to the referring Branch link, rather than to the Journey. If \nmake_new_link\n is set to \ntrue\n, the same events will be attributed to the Journey, instead.\n\n\nThis can help you collect data on how the referring links are contributing to app growth/engagement, even when users aren\u2019t installing from those links directly. For example, if a user clicked a Branch link on Facebook, landed on your website, and installed from a Journey, this would allow you to attribute the install to the link on Facebook. If the original link was also configured to deep link into your app, that deep link would be preserved, too.\n\n\nBranch will pass the referring link into Journeys by default. In order to discard referring link data, include the \nmake_new_link\n flag, with a value of  \ntrue\n, into the options during initialization:\n\n\nbranch\n.\ninit\n(\n \nBRANCH_KEY\n,\n\n    \n{\n\n        \nmake_new_link\n \n:\n \ntrue\n\n    \n}\n\n\n);\n\n\n\n\n\nPrioritization\n\n\nWhen do my Journeys prioritization rules apply?\n\n\nPrioritization only takes effect when two Journeys are overlapping. If you have a Journey targeting iOS users and a Journey targeting Android users, the prioritization won't matter. If you update the Journey targeting iOS to now target iOS and Android users, the higher priority Journey will show to Android users.\n\n\nWhat happens if a user dismisses a banner or interstitial?\n\n\nAssuming it fits your audience rule, your highest priority Journey is shown. If that Journey is dismissed, no other Journeys will show to respect the user's preference for not seeing a Journey when those rules are applied. To maximize Journey visibility, make your interstitial rules narrow (for example, showing on specific URLs) and your banner rules broad.\n\n\nWhy do I have to prioritize Stopped and Draft Journeys?\n\n\nWe ask you to prioritize all non-Archived Journeys because Journeys can be set live from \nDraft\n or \nStopped\n mode.\n\n\nWhat happens if I have some Journeys with priorities set and some without?\n\n\nWe recommend setting priority for all Journeys. All new Journeys you create will automatically have the lowest priority assigned to them, as well as \nDraft\n or \nStopped\n Journeys \nwithout priority\n that are set live (Journeys with priority will not have their priority changed unless you explicitly set them). If you don't set a priority for all your Journeys, then any matching Journey (i.e. Journey passing the audience filter you set) without priority will be picked at random to show.\n\n\nScheduling\n\n\nYou can set a time when your Journey will become active and be visible to your users and/or a time when it will no longer be displayed. You can also schedule Journeys on a recurring basis. \n\n\nYou can access this feature from the \nValidate \n Test\n step or directly from the action menu on the Journeys manager page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Scheduling a Journey\n\n\nImagine you want to show your users a Journey during the month of November that advertises a 25% sale if they download your app. You can set it to start at 12 AM on November 1st, and end at 12 AM on December 1st:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Recurring Schedules\n\n\nImagine you have a show that airs from 9-10 PM every Sunday, and you want to encourage users to view the episode in-app during that time. You can set a start time of 9 PM on the upcoming Sunday, set a stop time of 10 PM that same day, and then set it to repeat weekly:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheduling FAQ\n\n\n\n\nWhen does my scheduled Journey become active or stopped?\n\n   There can be up to a 5 minute delay between a scheduled time and your Journey becoming active or stopped.\n\n\nHow do I set an end date for a Journey with a recurring schedule?\n\n   This is not supported with scheduling at this time. To do this, set a start and stop time for your Journey and add your repeat rules. When you want the Journey to stop for good, stop it from the action menu or Edit Schedule \n Delete.\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Journeys layout customization\n\n\nWe now support the use case where you can customize the appearance of a Journey depending on which link referred the web session. So, you can create a Branch link with a set of defined keys and values that will change properties such as the title or images when the user is referred to your website from this link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLink Data Key\n\n\nValue\n\n\nExample Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$journeys_button_get_has_app\n\n\nThe call to action button when the app is currently installed\n\n\n\"Open App\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$journeys_button_get_no_app\n\n\nThe call to action button when the app is \nnot\n currently installed\n\n\n\"Install App\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$journeys_title\n\n\nThe title or main text of your Journey\n\n\n\"Download Appsolutely today\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$journeys_description\n\n\nThis is the description or subtitle in the frame\n\n\n\"This app is disrupting apps\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$journeys_icon_image_url\n\n\nThe app icon displayed in the layout\n\n\n\"\nhttps://mysite.com/image.png\n)\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that not all template support all override keys. For example, the floating button does not support title, description or icon image url. If a template is to be rendered and the key you've specified does not exist, we'll simply ignore it while rendering the template.\n\n\nCustom tags for dynamic Journeys layout customization\n\n\nIn addition to using \npre-defined keys\n (e.g. $journeys_title) to dynamically customize the appearance/content of a Journey, you can use custom liquid tags. Custom tags can be inserted in both the View Editor and the CSS Editor when you\u2019re setting up a Journeys template. Then, you can use \nsetBranchViewData()\n to dynamically provide values for these tags. \n\n\nNote that if you include custom liquid tags in your templates and also set a value for a pre-defined key (e.g. $journeys_title) in \nsetBranchViewData()\n, the value of the pre-defined key will take precedence.\n\n\nThe format for a custom liquid tag is as follows. Note that a default value must be specified for every custom tag you include:\n\n\n{{\n \nkey_name\n \n|\n \ndefault_value\n \n}}\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if you were adding a custom liquid tag in CSS to dynamically control the font size of one of your Journeys\u2019 title, you might use a tag like the one below:\n\n\n{{\n \nfontSize\n \n|\n \n12\npx\n \n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd if you were adding a custom liquid tag in your template text, you might use a tag like the one below:\n\n{{\n \nadjective\n \n|\n \nbest\n \n}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, to dynamically update values for the \u201cfontSize\u201d and \u201cadjective\u201d variables, you would set values for those variables using \nsetBranchViewData()\n:\n\n\nbranch.setBranchViewData({\n    data: {\n        \nfontSize\n: \n20px\n,\n        \nadjective\n: \nmost entertaining\n,\n    }\n});\n\n\n\n\nClientside Javascript Journeys controls\n\n\nThere are a number of clientside APIs to help you build quality user experiences. See below:\n\n\nUse Javascript to block a Journey from showing\n\n\nYou can prevent Journeys from showing on a certain page by inserting \nno_journeys\n with the value of \ntrue\n into the options during initialization.\n\n\nscript\n \ntype=\ntext/javascript\n\n// load the Branch SDK file\nbranch.init(\nBRANCH_KEY\n,\n    {\n      \nno_journeys\n: true\n    }\n);\n\n/script\n\n\n\n\n\nClosing a Journey Programmatically\n\n\nJourneys include a close button the user can click, but you may want to close the Journey with a timeout, or via some other user interaction with your web app.\nIn this case, closing the Journey is very simple by calling:\n\n\nbranch\n.\ncloseJourney\n(\nfunction\n(\nerr\n)\n \n{\n \nconsole\n.\nlog\n(\nerr\n);\n \n});\n\n\n\n\n\nTrigger a Journey to Show by Firing an Event\n\n\nIf you block or programatically close a Journey via one the calls above, then you can trigger a Journey to show by firing the following event:\n\n\nbranch\n.\ntrack\n(\npageview\n);\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n If a user has closed a Journey in the past, then firing the aforementioned event will not override a user's preference.\n\n\nDisable Journeys Animations\n\n\nYou can disable Journeys animations on a page by setting two flags - \ndisable_entry_animation\n and \ndisable_exit_animation\n - when you\u2019re calling either init() or track() with Branch\u2019s Web SDK.\n\n\nJourneys animations can be disabled in order to reduce the amount of time it takes to load a Journey on a page. They can also be disabled in order to improve Journeys UX on single-page web apps, where Journeys animations can be jarring. When switching between multiple Journeys on a single-page web app, remember to use \nsetBranchViewData()\n to change the link behind the CTA.\n\n\nTo disable animations during initialization, insert \ndisable_entry_animation\n and/or \ndisable_exit_animation\n, with values of \ntrue\n, into the options:\n\n\nbranch\n.\ninit\n(\n\u2018\nBRANCH_KEY\n\u2019\n,\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n\u2018\ndisable_entry_animation\n\u2019\n \n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n        \n\u2018\ndisable_exit_animation\n\u2019\n \n:\n \ntrue\n\n    \n}\n\n\n);\n\n\n\n\n\nTo disable animations using track(), insert \ndisable_entry_animation\n and/or \ndisable_exit_animation\n, with values of \ntrue\n, into the event metadata:\n\n\nbranch\n.\ntrack\n(\n\n    \n\u2018\npageview\n\u2019\n,\n\n    \n{},\n\n    \n{\n\n        \n\u2018\ndisable_entry_animation\n\u2019\n \n:\n \ntrue\n,\n\n        \n\u2018\ndisable_exit_animation\n\u2019\n \n:\n \ntrue\n\n    \n}\n\n\n);\n\n\n\n\n\nListen to Journeys lifecycle events\n\n\nYou can easily listen to Journeys lifecycle events by registering listener functions like so:\n\n\nvar\n \nlistener\n \n=\n \nfunction\n(\nevent\n)\n \n{\n \nconsole\n.\nlog\n(\nevent\n);\n \n}\n\n\n\n// Specify an event to listen for\n\n\nbranch\n.\naddListener\n(\nwillShowJourney\n,\n \nlistener\n);\n\n\n\n// Listen for all events\n\n\nbranch\n.\naddListener\n(\nlistener\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListener Name\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwillShowJourney\n\n\nJourney is about to be shown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndidShowJourney\n\n\nJourney's entrance animation has completed and it is being shown to the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwillNotShowJourney\n\n\nJourney will not be shown and no other events will be emitted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndidClickJourneyCTA\n\n\nUser clicked on Journey's CTA button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndidClickJourneyClose\n\n\nUser clicked on Journey's close button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwillCloseJourney\n\n\nJourney close animation has started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndidCloseJourney\n\n\nJourney's close animation has completed and it is no longer visible to the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJourneys text localization\n\n\nJourneys now has an entire localization framework. Due to the complexity of this offering, we're not exposing it directly to partners. Please reach out to your account manager or \n to receive access to this functionality.\n\n\nCSS Editor\n\n\nIf you have an upgraded premium account, you may also modify your CSS code directly in addition to using the WYSIWYG View Editor.

Here are are a couple common audience use cases to help you get started.\n\n\n\n\nNew users\n\n\nLoyal users\n\n\nRetargeting users who have taken some action\n\n\nUsers from Google (for SEO)\n\n\niOS users from English-speaking countries\n\n\n\n\nAll of these examples require you to configure advanced audience rules, which is a premium feature. You can add any set of complex rules using the following button:\n\n\n\n\nNew Users\n\n\nIn this example, you'll configure an audience to target people who have visited your site \nless than 3 times\n historically. Anyone who had visited more than this will be excluded. First, you'll add a new rule for \nHas visted web\n in the advanced section.\n\n\n\n\nNext, you'll choose the \nLess than or equal to\n in the middle section:\n\n\n\n\nFinally, you'll enter 2 in the last part to indicate you want to target people who have visited less than 3 times historically.\n\n\n\n\nSave and continue!\n\n\nLoyal Users\n\n\nIn this example, you'll configure an audience to target people who have visited your site \nmore than 4 times\n historically. Anyone who had visited less than this will be excluded. First, you'll add a new rule for \nHas visted web\n in the advanced section.\n\n\n\n\nNext, you'll choose the \nMore than or equal to\n in the middle section:\n\n\n\n\nFinally, you'll enter 5 in the last part to indicate you want to target people who have visited more than 4 times historically.\n\n\n\n\nSave and continue!\n\n\nRetargeting Users\n\n\nIn this example, you'll configure an audience to target people who have completed some action on your site in a past or current session. For example, if a user had added something to their cart or had previously completed a purchase. You can retarget these users with a custom call to action to download. We'll use a generic event called \nMyAction\n in the example. First, you'll add a new rule for \nHas completed event\n in the advanced section.\n\n\n\n\nIn this next dropdown, you'll choose the custom event to retarget from. Here, we'll use a generic event called \nMyAction\n but you would select \nPurchase\n or something more meaningful to your use case.\n\n\n\n\nNext, you'll choose the \nMore than or equal to\n in the middle section:\n\n\n\n\nFinally, you'll enter 3 in the last part to indicate you want to target people who have completed \nMyAction\n more than 2 times historically.\n\n\n\n\nSave and continue!\n\n\nSEO Friendly\n\n\nGoogle has recently announced that it will begin punishing sites that show a full page interstitial when a user comes from search. Because of this, you'll likely need to treat Google search traffic differently than traffic that comes from any other source. In this example, you'll set up an audience specific to users who come from Google. First, you'll add a new rule for \nCame directly from a url\n in the advanced section.\n\n\n\n\nNext, you'll choose the \nstarts with\n in the middle section to match a substring:\n\n\n\n\nFinally, you'll enter \ngoogle.com\n to target users who came from Google search (where the referrer starts with google.com):\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can target users who did NOT come from Google search (where the referrer doesn't start with google.com):\n\n\n\n\nExample: English speaking iOS users\n\n\nIn this example, you'll restrict the audience to users in countries where English is the native language who are on the iOS operating system. Note that this is not in the advanced audience section, but rather in the top section. First, select \niOS\n of the mobile OS checkboxes.\n\n\n\n\nNext, go through and choose the following countries: \nUnited States\n, \nCanada\n, \nUnited Kingdom\n and \nAustralia\n.\n\n\n\n\nSave and continue!",

Converting your mobile web visitors into native app users is one of the most effective acquisition channels available, and Branch's Journeys App Banners platform makes this easy.    Customizable presentation.  WYSIWYG designer for smart banner or full-page interstitial, with more coming soon.  Powerful targeting rules.  Want to show your Journey only visitors without your app installed already? All iOS users from Japan? Just users viewing your checkout page? Android users who have visited your website twice AND purchased something using your app? The possibilities are infinite.  AMP-compatible.  You can convert mobile search traffic to your app by  showing Journeys on AMP pages .  Run A/B tests.  Design multiple campaign versions to see which converts most effectively.  Optimized user experience.  If installed, your app will open and users can be routed directly to the content they expect. If not, the App/Play store will open and users can still be routed directly to the content they expect after installing.  Comprehensive analytics.  Measure the downstream performance and retention of every Journeys campaign.    Journeys is a paid product  Journeys introduces many more advanced features on top of the basic smart app banner functionality, but  you can still create an Android and iOS smart app banner for free if your MAU are under 20k . After 20k MAU, we'd ask that you pay a small fee for use. Premium-only advanced features (including the option to run multiple Journeys simultaneously) are available through a 14 day trial.

Note that if you include custom liquid tags in your templates and also set a value for a pre-defined key (e.g. $journeys_title) in  setBranchViewData() , the value of the pre-defined key will take precedence.  The format for a custom liquid tag is as follows. Note that a default value must be specified for every custom tag you include:  {{   key_name   |   default_value   }}   For example, if you were adding a custom liquid tag in CSS to dynamically control the font size of one of your Journeys\u2019 title, you might use a tag like the one below:  {{   fontSize   |   12 px   }}    And if you were adding a custom liquid tag in your template text, you might use a tag like the one below: {{   adjective   |   best   }}    Then, to dynamically update values for the \u201cfontSize\u201d and \u201cadjective\u201d variables, you would set values for those variables using  setBranchViewData() :  branch.setBranchViewData({\n    data: {\n         fontSize :  20px ,\n         adjective :  most entertaining ,\n    }\n});",

Next, you'll choose the  starts with  in the middle section to match a substring:   Finally, you'll enter  google.com  to target users who came from Google search (where the referrer starts with google.com):   Alternatively, you can target users who did NOT come from Google search (where the referrer doesn't start with google.com):",

            "text": "Overview\n\n\nAccelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)\n are a way to build pages that serve static content so that they load in Google search results much faster. Google uses AMP to quickly serve content on mobile devices without users having to click through to a website to view the content, and AMP pages often appear at the top of mobile search results.\n\n\nAMP pages by design make it difficult for users to go anywhere except back to Google search, and difficult for you to convert users to your website or your app. With AMP-compatible Journeys, you can convert mobile web traffic from Google search results to your app and take advantage of extra traffic from AMP pages. Select Journeys templates can be shown on your AMP-compatible website.\n\n\n\n\nPre-reqs\n\n\n\n\nTo host AMP Journeys and show in Google search as an AMP page, your webpage must be \nAMP\n-compatible.\n\n\nJourneys uses your alternate domain for Universal Links. Make sure you include your \nxxxx-alternate.app.link\n domain in your \nAssociated Domains\n. If you\u2019re unsure of your Branch-assigned app.link subdomain, \ncontact support\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\n\nAdd the Branch AMP SDK to your site\n\n\nThe AMP SDK consists of 2-3 snippets that you can insert into your AMP page.\n\n\nAdd the following snippet between the AMP page\u2019s \nhead\n/head\n tags\n\n\n   \nstyle\n \namp-custom\n#\nbranch-amp-journey\n{\nbottom\n:\n0\n;\nleft\n:\n0\n;\nwidth\n:\n100\n%\n;\nheight\n:\n77\npx\n;\nposition\n:\nfixed\n;}.\nhideme\n{\nwidth\n:\n100\n%\n;\nheight\n:\n77\npx\n;\nleft\n:\n24\npx\n;\nbackground-color\n:\nnone\n;\nposition\n:\nfixed\n;}.\nclose\n{\nwidth\n:\n24\npx\n;\nheight\n:\n100\n%\n;\nleft\n:\n0\n;\nz-index\n:\n10000\n;\nbackground-color\n:\nnone\n;\nposition\n:\nfixed\n;}.\nbranch-amp-journey-inner\n{\nposition\n:\nrelative\n;\nwidth\n:\n100\n%\n;\nheight\n:\n100\n%\n;\nz-index\n:\n9999\n;}.\ndonotdisplay\n{\ndisplay\n:\nnone\n;}\n/\nstyle\n\n\n\n\n\nModify the following snippet to include your domain instead of \nDOMAIN_HERE\n and your Branch key instead of \nBRANCH_KEY_HERE\n - in both the \namp-list\n tag and the \namp-iframe\n tag.

For example, you should include a tag like this in the \nhead\n/head\n section of your AMP page: \nlink rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https://example.com/article.html\"\n. This helps make your AMP page discoverable, and likely helps ensure that SEO information is shared between these two pages. Additionally, Branch automatically embeds the canonical URL in the Journey link data, leading to better identification of content and the ability to use this key for deep linking.\n\n\n\n\nTarget AMP Web in your audience\n\n\nAMP Journeys can be created as part of the normal \nJourneys creation flow\n. You can target users on AMP pages by checking the box \nAMP Web\n on the Select Audience step:\n\n\n\n\nSee the \nJourneys Guide\n for more information on selecting your audience.\n\n\nSelect an AMP-compatible template\n\n\nOnce you have your audience selected, you can configure your templates. Currently, only \nBranch Standard Banner Bottom\n is supported on AMP because Google requires that banners not show in the top 75% of an AMP page. Over time, Branch will add support for more Journeys templates.\n\n\nWhen you click \nSelect Template\n from the \nConfigure Views\n step, the \nstandard bottom banner\n view type should already be selected, showing you the Journeys templates that are compatible with AMP:\n\n\n\n\nHover over the template and click \nCreate\n.\n\n\nValidate \n Test your AMP Journey\n\n\nOn the \nValidate \n Test\n step, you will see AMP-specific messages if you have targeted \nAMP Web\n users on the \nSelect Audience\n step.\n\n\n\n\nThe selected template is not AMP-compatible\n\n\nIf Branch has detected that you have selected a template that is not compatible with AMP, you will see an error on the \nValidate \n Test\n step. \nSee which templates are currently compatible\n.\n\n\nTrack Analytics\n\n\nAnalytics for AMP Journeys works the \nsame way as for regular Journeys\n, in that you can see clicks, opens, installs, and custom events tied to your Journey by clicking \nView Performance\n from the actions menu for your AMP Journey.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced\n\n\nTargeting Audiences with a URL\n\n\nWith AMP, Google will serve your page from the Google AMP cache. This means that the URL that serves your AMP page will look something like \nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.example.com/amp/doc.html\n. However, Branch passes through your original source URL, and this is what you should use for audience targeting. For the advanced audience filter \nIs viewing a page URL\n, you'll want to use the original URL where you host the AMP page. In this example, that would be \nhttps://www.example.com/amp/doc.html\n.\n\n\nDeep linking with AMP\n\n\nYou can [configure links] with deep link data on AMP in two ways:\n\n\n\n\nAdd query parameters to your Branch link in the AMP SDK\n\n\nAdd deep link data to a Journey in the dashboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse $canonical_url for deep linking\n\n\nAMP Journeys, along with regular Journeys and the Quick Link Creator, automatically embeds \n$canonical_url\n in your link data based on meta tags on your web or AMP page. If you use this key to route to specific content in your app, you do not have to add anything extra for AMP.\n\n\n\n\nAdd query parameters in the AMP SDK\n\n\nTo deep link to specific content in your app, you can add query parameters to your Branch link within the \namp-iframe\n. Here is what the \namp-iframe\n looks like without any query parameters:\n\n\namp-iframe\n \nclass=\nbranch-amp-journey-inner \n{{\ndo_not_display\n}}\n \nlayout=\nfixed-height\n \nheight=\n77px\n \nresizable\n \nsrc=\nhttps://DOMAIN-HERE/branch-amp-journeys?branch_key=BRANCH_KEY_HERE\n__aj_cid=\n{{\n__aj_cid\n}}\n__aj_source_url=\n{{\n__aj_source_url\n}}\n__aj_canonical_url=\n{{\n__aj_canonical_url\n}}\n_audience_rule_id=\n{{\n_audience_rule_id\n}}\n_branch_view_id=\n{{\n_branch_view_id\n}}\n__aj_v=1.0.0\n \nsandbox=\nallow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-same-origin\n \nframeborder=\n0\ndiv\n \noverflow\n/div\n/amp-iframe\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your deep linking keys were \nproductId\n and \ncategory\n, for example, you would add \nproductId=1234\ncategory=shoes\n to your \namp-iframe\n like this:\n\n\namp-iframe\n \nclass=\nbranch-amp-journey-inner \n{{\ndo_not_display\n}}\n \nlayout=\nfixed-height\n \nheight=\n77px\n \nresizable\n \nsrc=\nhttps://DOMAIN-HERE/branch-amp-journeys?branch_key=BRANCH_KEY_HERE\n__aj_cid=\n{{\n__aj_cid\n}}\n__aj_source_url=\n{{\n__aj_source_url\n}}\n__aj_canonical_url=\n{{\n__aj_canonical_url\n}}\n_audience_rule_id=\n{{\n_audience_rule_id\n}}\n_branch_view_id=\n{{\n_branch_view_id\n}}\n__aj_v=1.0.0\nproductId=1234\ncategory=shoes\n \nsandbox=\nallow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-same-origin\n \nframeborder=\n0\ndiv\n \noverflow\n/div\n/amp-iframe\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are generating AMP pages programmatically, it makes sense to generate these keys as query params at the same time.\n\n\nDynamic layout customization\n\n\nYou can customize the appearance of a Journey dynamically using query parameters on your \namp-iframe\n link. These are the fields currently supported for dynamic layout customization on AMP:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLink Data Key\n\n\nValue\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$journeys_button_get_has_app\n\n\nThe call to action button when the app is currently installed\n\n\n$journeys_button_get_has_app=Download\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$journeys_button_get_no_app\n\n\nThe call to action button when the app is \nnot\n currently installed\n\n\n$journeys_button_get_no_app=Read\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$journeys_description\n\n\nThis is the description or subtitle in the frame\n\n\n$journeys_description=Continue+reading+in+the+app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd deep link data in the Journeys dashboard\n\n\nYou can also add deep link data to a Journey in the dashboard. In the \nCustomize Template\n screen, click the button and add your key:value pairs in the deep link data fields. For example if your deep linking key was \nproductId\n:\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nAMP-specific Restrictions\n\n\nBecause javascript is limited on AMP and cookies are restricted on both AMP and iOS, AMP Journeys does not support all of standard Journeys functionality. The following Journeys features are affected:\n\n\n\n\nEvent-based audience rules work within AMP only or after a Branch link click on an AMP page. \nRead more\n.\n\n\nOnly templates on the bottom of the page and equal to 76px in height show on AMP. \nRead more\n.\n\n\nDismiss period\n is not supported - after dismiss, Journeys will show again during the next AMP session.\n\n\nClient-side javascript controls\n are not supported.\n\n\nAuto-opening the app with open_app: true is not supported.\n\n\nDeep linking with setBranchViewData\n is not supported. \nLearn how\n you can deep link to content from AMP pages.\n\n\nIf your site uses a template engine like Jinja that looks for and replaces liquid tags (ex: {{ yourObject }}), then you should confirm that it does not remove Branch tags on render. For Jinja specifically, you should wrap the Branch code on your AMP page with raw tags:\n\n{% raw %}\n\namp-list\n \ntabindex=\n0\n \nrole=\n \non=\ntap:branch-amp-journey.hide\n \nid=\nbranch-amp-journey\n \nsrc=\nhttps://DOMAIN-HERE/branch-amp-journeys-pre?branch_key=BRANCH_KEY_HERE\n_aj_cid=CLIENT_ID(_s)\namp_viewer=VIEWER\naj_source_url=SOURCE_URL\naj_canonical_url=CANONICAL_URL\naj_v=1.0.0\n \nlayout=\nfixed-height\n \nheight=\n77px\ntemplate\n \ntype=\namp-mustache\n \nid=\njourney-template\na\n \nclass=\nclose\n \non=\ntap:branch-amp-journey.hide\n/a\ndiv\n \nclass=\nhideme\n \n/div\namp-iframe\n \nclass=\nbranch-amp-journey-inner\u00a0do_not_display\n \nlayout=\nfixed-height\n \nheight=\n77px\n \nresizable\n \nsrc=\nhttps://DOMAIN-HERE/branch-amp-journeys?branch_key=BRANCH_KEY_HERE\naj_cid=aj_cid\naj_source_url=aj_source_url\naj_canonical_url=aj_canonical_url\n_audience_rule_id=_audience_rule_id\n_branch_view_id=_branch_view_id\n_aj_v=1.0.0\n \nsandbox=\nallow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-same-origin\n \nframeborder=\n0\ndiv\n \noverflow\n/div\n/amp-iframe\n/template\n/amp-list\n\n{% endraw %}\n\n\n\n\n\nTargeting Limitations\n\n\nBecause cookies are restricted on both AMP and iOS, event-based audience rules on AMP Journeys are cookie-restricted. Practically, this means that targeting works \nonly within AMP\n for the following rules:\n\n\n\n\nHas completed event\n\n\nHas visited web\n\n\nHas visited the app\n\n\nHas the app installed\n\n\n\n\nOnce a user has clicked a Branch link outside of AMP, event-based audience rules will adhere to the regular web cookie for that user, and will work across AMP and non-AMP web.\n\n\nBanner Limitations\n\n\nFor the time being, only banners of a fixed height and placement (bottom of the page) are compatible with AMP. This includes \nBranch Banner Bottom\n, or other custom banners with page placement on the bottom of the page and height of 76px.",

From here, you can customize the HTML and CSS, and Branch will take care of the rest. If you want to further customize the page or SMS message itself, read further.\n\n\nAdvanced\n\n\nUse your own SMS service\n\n\nBranch uses Twilio to provide your users the ability to text themselves the app for free, but you can roll your own SMS service by using the following basic logic:\n\n\n\n\nDoes \n~referring_link\n exist? (a.k.a. did the user end up on this Text Me The App page because of a Branch link?) If so, use this link when sending the SMS.\n\n\nIf not (\n~referring_link\n is null), generate a new Branch link by making a call to the Web SDK's \nlink()\n method. Use this link when sending the SMS.\n\n\n\n\nThe \n~referring_link\n parameter is returned in the Web SDK's init() callback, buried in the referring link data. See the code below:\n\n\nbranch\n.\ninit\n(\nYOUR-BRANCH-KEY\n,\n \nfunction\n(\nerr\n,\n \ndata\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n \n(\ndata\n.\ndata\n[\n~referring_link\n])\n \n{\n\n        \nconsole\n.\nlog\n(\ndata.data[\n~referring_link\n]:\n,\n \ndata\n.\ndata\n[\n~referring_link\n]);\n\n    \n}\n\n\n});\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a custom form with SendSMS()\n\n\nIf you have an existing form for users to input their phone number, you can put our Text Me The App behind it. Add the following code somewhere inside the \nhead\n/head\n tags on your website.\n\n\nscript\n \ntype\n=\ntext/javascript\n\n\nfunction\n \nsendSMS\n(\nform\n)\n \n{\n\n  \nbranch\n.\nsendSMS\n(\n\n    \nphone\n: \nform.phone.text\n,\n\n    \n{\n\n      \nchannel\n:\n \nWebsite\n,\n\n      \nfeature\n:\n \nText-Me-The-App\n,\n\n      \ndata\n:\n \n{\n\n        \nfoo\n:\n \nbar\n\n      \n}\n\n    \n},\n\n    \n{\n \nmake_new_link\n: \nfalse\n \n},\n \n// Default: false. If set to true, sendSMS will generate a new link even if one already exists.\n\n    \nfunction\n(\nerr\n)\n \n{\n \nconsole\n.\nlog\n(\nerr\n);\n \n}\n\n  \n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n/script\n\n\n\n\n\nCall sendSMS when someone enters something into your form.\n\n\nCustomize SMS message content\n\n\nThe default text for SMS messages is \"Click here to download [App Name] {{ link }}\".\n\n\nIf you want to customize this, Branch allows you to set a default for all messages, or customize the message for each link.\n\n\nCustomize all messages\n\n\nYou can create your own custom default message that will be sent if the specific link someone clicks doesn't have a customized message itself. Navigate back to the Desktop SMS page on the \nBranch dashboard\n. You should see the following section below.\n\n\n\n\nEditing this field will modify \nall\n SMS messages sent.\n\n\nCustom link-specific messages\n\n\nIf you don't want to edit the global SMS text, you can define a special SMS message for each individual link. Whether you want to switch the language of a message for a different region or include device specific date, you can specify the message in the \nDeep Link Data\n section at the bottom of the link editing screen.\n\n\n\n\nUse the \n$custom_sms_text\n parameter and then enter your custom message in the value section. Make sure to include the \n{{ link }}\n tag in your custom message! Read the following scenario below to see this in action.\n\n\nThe developer of FlowerPower wants to customize the SMS messages based on the country of the recipient. For each Branch link, they would specify in the deep link data a different custom message.\n\n\nFor ads in France:\n\nCliquez pour t\u00e9l\u00e9charger FlowerPower ici {{ link }}\n\n\nFor ads in Spain:\n\nHaz click aqu\u00ed para descargar FlowerPower {{ link }}\n\n\nFor ads in Germany:\n\nKlicken Sie auf das FlowerPower hier herunterladen {{ link }}\n\n\nUse liquid tags to further customize messages\n\n\nYou can access almost any value of your link's parameters by using liquid tags. The customization options are only limited to your imagination.\n\n\n\n\nThe tag \n{{ link }}\n is replaced with your Branch link\n\n\n{{ link.channel }}\n and \n{{ link.campaign }}\n output the channel and campaign, if these were set when creating the link.\n\n\n{{ link.data.key }}\n will output a parameter of your link's data dictionary, where \nkey\n is the name of the parameter\n\n\n\n\nHere's an example to illustrate this scenario.\n\n\nDmitri is creating Branch links to deep link to each of the different flowers in his app FlowerPower. He creates each link with a key/value pair of the key \nflower\n and the flower name, e.g. \nFlower : Rose\n, \nFlower : Tulip\n. He wants to customize his SMS messages based on name of the flower, so he sets his custom link messages as:\n\n\n{{ link.data.flower }}\ns on the mind? Click here to buy some for your home! \n{{ link }}\n\n\n\n\nGlossary\n\n\nSendSMS() parameters\n\n\nThe \nsendSMS()\n method requires a phone number and \nlink parameters\n. You may optionally specify configuration options and a callback.\n\n\nbranch\n.\nsendSMS\n(\n\n    \nphone\n,\n\n    \nlinkData\n,\n\n    \noptions\n,\n\n    \ncallback\n \n(\nerr\n,\n \ndata\n)\n\n\n);\n\n\n\n\n\nYour call to this method, once filled in with the user's phone number, could look like the following:\n\n\nbranch\n.\nsendSMS\n(\n\n    \nphone\n:\n \n9999999999\n,\n\n    \n{\n\n        \ntags\n:\n \n[\ntag1\n,\n \ntag2\n],\n\n        \nchannel\n:\n \nfacebook\n,\n\n        \nfeature\n:\n \ndashboard\n,\n\n        \nstage\n:\n \nnew user\n,\n\n        \ndata\n:\n \n{\n\n            \nfoo\n:\n \nbar\n\n        \n}\n\n    \n},\n\n    \n{\n \nmake_new_link\n:\n \nfalse\n \n},\n \n// Default: false. If set to true, sendSMS will generate a new link even if one already exists.\n\n    \nfunction\n(\nerr\n)\n \n{\n \nconsole\n.\nlog\n(\nerr\n);\n \n}\n\n\n});\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting default replacement values for liquid tags\n\n\nIf a specific tag isn't always going to be filled, you can use a \n|\n character to specify a default to fallback on if the tag is missing from your link dictionary.\n\n\nE.g. \n{{ link.data.author | default:\"Alex\" }}\n\n\nIf the \nlink.data.author\n information isn't found, the tag will just be replaced with \nAlex\n instead of being replaced by an empty string.\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\nWhat are the SMS rate limits?\n\n\nWe enforce the following rate limits when sending SMS through Branch:\n\n\n\n\n5 texts to the same number within an hour.\n\n\n100 texts from the same IP within an hour.\n\n\n\n\nCan I use this service for international phone numbers?\n\n\nYes. Branch uses Twilio to send SMS messages, which means SMS will be delivered all around the world. However, please note that the number the SMS has to be delivered to, must be in the same country the SMS is being sent from.\n\n\nI've sent myself multiple texts just now and only received the first few, what's going on?\n\n\nThis occurs when a carrier filters you SMS out due to spam. We try our hardest to rate limit a specific user, however, if bypassed, carriers may block your SMS. The reason is that carriers will aggressively block content if it's similar and repeatedly sent to the same number. The solution is to wait 24-48 hours.\n\n\nHow come my (non US) phone number isn't working?\n\n\nWith full numbers, you are required to use \"+\" and the country code. If you know your users are only in a certain country, you can automatically prepend \"+\" and the country code so that they only need to enter their regular number. To do this, you must create a custom text-me-the-app page. Then, you can alter the code snippet in \nstep 2\n with the following:\n\n\n    \nvar\n \nphone\n \n=\n \n+91\n \n+\n \nform\n.\nphone\n.\nvalue\n;\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, \"+91\" is the code for the country your users are based in.\n\n\nWhy have the SMS links sent from Text Me The App expired?\n\n\nA: All links links generated from the Text Me the App feature will expire after 7 days.",

With Deep Linked Feeds for Dynamic Ads, advertisers can easily create mobile-optimized links at scale for dynamic ad campaigns. By taking users to the most relevant content on the most relevant platform (web or app) advertisers can maximize revenue and engagement opportunities on mobile.\n\n\nDeep Linked Feeds takes an existing product feed and adds correct deep links for each piece of content.\n\n\nTake advantage of our visual interface for uploading and managing feeds, or set up a more automated integration between you, Branch and your ad network of choice.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis product is a part of Branch Universal Ads.\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\n\nPre-requisites\n\n\n\n\nTo use Deep Linked Feeds you must integrate the Branch SDK.\n\n\nTo use your Deep Linked Feed on Facebook, make sure you've configured and enabled Facebook as an advertising partner on the \nBranch\n dashboard.\n\n\n\n\nPrepare your Feed Source\n\n\nTo create a deep linked feed, upload a content or product feed. In Branch terminology, this is called a \nFeed Source\n.\n\n\nWhen you need to create a \nDeep Linked Feed\n you'll go through a creation flow that will ask you to select a Feed Source for modification.\n\n\nYou'll be asked to enter some attribution tags and optionally configure linking. After you've done this, Branch will prepare a Deep Linked Feed, adding any missing columns that are needed, or editing existing columns to use the correct links for deep linking. More specifics on the transformation process can be found in our Advanced section.\n\n\nA couple of things to note:\n\n\n\n\nBe sure that your Feed Source has a \nlink\n column with each product's web URL. This is the minimum requirement for Branch to create deep links (although it will likely not be sufficient to be accepted by Facebook or partners.)\n\n\nWe recommend \nhosting deep link data\n on your website for each web URL in your feed. We won't use it to modify your feed, but when your link is clicked from an ad, we'll get the link data from your website and return it to your app.\n\n\n\n\nIf you choose this option, go to your \nLink Settings\n \n Advanced Settings and check \nEnable Link Scraping\n. This option is only available once you've enabled the Deep Linked Feeds product for your account (you can enable the product by creating and downloading a Deep Linked Feed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you can't host your link data, add the necessary link data as a column in the Feed Source.\n\n\nWant to get creative with your Feed Sources? Check out our \nAdvanced section\n for some power user tips.\n\n\nBranch accepts feed sources that are compatible with Facebook\u2019s format. If you\u2019re not sure about the compatibility of your feed, please use \nFacebook\u2019s Product Feed Debug Tool\n to test and debug it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Feed Source\n\n\nFacebook has example CSVs that Branch accepts as Feed Sources on the \nFacebook Developer Portal\n. Scroll down to \"Supported Formats\" to find the feed examples.\n\n\n\n\nUpload a Feed Source\n\n\nGo directly to \nAds \n Links \n Feed Sources section\n in the Branch dashboard to get started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the \nFeed Sources\n tab if needed, then click \"Add New Feed Source.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName your Feed Source.

You'll also input the Ad Platform on which you'd like to run your campaigns.

The first is a list of column names from your feed source. To add deep link data to each link, select the column that contains the relevant data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's say you have a column in your product feed titled \nid\n. That column contains the product id for each piece of content in your Feed Source file, and your app needs that id to deep link correctly. To create deep links with that id for each product, select the column by checking the box on the left hand side. If you'd like to change the name of the key (for example, from \nid\n to \nproduct_id\n) you can write the new name for the key in the text box on the right hand side. This will add the correct \nproduct_id\n to each link for every single product in your feed (e.g. the first item will have \n\"product_id\":1392\n, the second item will have \n\"product_id\":5284\n).\n\n\n\n\nGetting your Deep Linked Feed\n\n\nFinally, in \"Get Deep Linked Feed\" you can choose to get a URL that will host your Deep Linked Feed or download a file with your Deep Linked Feed.\n\n\nOnce you get to the final step, you will see \"Your links are being created...\" Feel free to navigate away if you have a large feed source. Once this process has completed, you will receive a dashboard notification and an email with a link to your finished Deep Linked Feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule refresh\n\n\nIf you used a Feed Source hosted on a URL (recommended), you will see two options for accessing your feed. We recommend selecting \"Schedule Refresh.\" If you select this option, Branch will host a URL for your Deep Linked Feed that will update itself from your Feed Source URL at regular intervals. You can then provide the Deep Linked Feed URL to your partners, and Branch will keep the content up to date.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see all of the \nDeep Linked Feeds\n you've created by going to the \nDeep Linked Feeds\n tab.\n\n\nDownload CSV\n\n\nClick \"Download CSV\" if you just need a one-time file with your Deep Linked Feed.\n\n\nYou can see all of the \nDeep Linked Feeds\n you've created by going to the \nDeep Linked Feeds\n tab.\n\n\nUse your Deep Linked Feed\n\n\nAfter you've downloaded your feed, it's time to use it!\n\n\n\n\nFacebook Dynamic Ads\n\n\nLaunch a \nFacebook Dynamic Ad Campaign\n to drive engagement or installs with your Deep Linked Feed!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd Network Integrations\n\n\nBranch Deep Linked Feeds are accepted by top remarketing companies like Criteo, Remerge and AppNexus.

This will make each link fall back to the platform fallback you have specified in your \nLink Settings\n, which is usually the App Store.\n\n\nFacebook requires certain \n\"applink treatment\"\n values to be present to change fallback behavior. We're working on adding these to our interface, but for the moment, include them in your feed source.\n\n\n\n\nDeep links aren't working\n\n\n\n\nEnsure you've included your deep link data.

Alternatively, you can include deep link data as a column in your Feed Source and then select the relevant data in Step 2 of Deep Linked creation.\n\n\nTo see which data is getting through to your app, click the link and then view the link click in \nLive View\n to see the data going through to your app.\n\n\nIf you don't know what deep link data you need to include, ask a technical teammate to show you which data is included in a working Branch link.\n\n\n\n\nFeed Source won't upload\n\n\n\n\nBranch accepts Feed Sources that are compatible with Facebook\u2019s \nfeed format\n.

When you need to create a  Deep Linked Feed  you'll go through a creation flow that will ask you to select a Feed Source for modification.  You'll be asked to enter some attribution tags and optionally configure linking. After you've done this, Branch will prepare a Deep Linked Feed, adding any missing columns that are needed, or editing existing columns to use the correct links for deep linking. More specifics on the transformation process can be found in our Advanced section.  A couple of things to note:   Be sure that your Feed Source has a  link  column with each product's web URL. This is the minimum requirement for Branch to create deep links (although it will likely not be sufficient to be accepted by Facebook or partners.)  We recommend  hosting deep link data  on your website for each web URL in your feed. We won't use it to modify your feed, but when your link is clicked from an ad, we'll get the link data from your website and return it to your app.   If you choose this option, go to your  Link Settings    Advanced Settings and check  Enable Link Scraping . This option is only available once you've enabled the Deep Linked Feeds product for your account (you can enable the product by creating and downloading a Deep Linked Feed).    If you can't host your link data, add the necessary link data as a column in the Feed Source.  Want to get creative with your Feed Sources? Check out our  Advanced section  for some power user tips.

You can then \nadd additional postbacks\n, for example, if you wanted to add postbacks for custom events that are specific to your app like \nAccount Created\n. You can also \nedit postbacks\n if there's additional data you really need to pass along to your ad partner.\n\n\n\n\nCreate an ad link\n\n\nOnce you've enabled an ad partner, it's time to create a tracking link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, select an ad format. For App Install or App Engagement campaigns you'll want to select the \nApp Only\n format. For Search or Display campaigns where the user should go to web if they don't have the app, then you should select \nCross-Platform Search\n or \nCross-Platform Display\n. \nProduct Links\n are for shopping or dynamic remarketing campaigns and will take you to create a Deep Linked Product Feed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point you need to name your link. Select something that will make it easy to find if you need it later. Your Ad Format and Ad Partner should be selected already, but feel free to choose one if they aren't. It's important that you select the right Ad Partner for analytics later on. Click \nConfigure Options\n to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is your chance to add deep link data and analytics tags. Analytics tags are important for later segmentation, so click the \nAnalytics\n sub tab to add a Channel and Campaign value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet Analytics tags\n\n\nIt's easier to slice your data in our analytics platform if you properly assign analytics parameters to your link. \nChannels\n generally correspond to ad networks, and \nCampaigns\n correspond to marketing initiatives that you're launching. For example: \nChannel\n: \"YouTube\", \nCampaign\n: \"Summer 2017 Shoe Discounts.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick \nCreate Link Now\n, and you have your tracking link! Take this link and give it to your Ad Partner's Account Manager or paste it into the tracking section of your campaign yourself.

If you have questions, just contact support and we'll get it sorted out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView your data with People-Based Attribution\n\n\nThe \nAds Analytics Page\n on the Branch dashboard shows the performance of your ad campaigns \nacross both web and app\n. You can view performance over time, including purchase and other custom events.\n\n\nEvents are attributed using Branch's unified last-click attribution model. This means that Branch will attribute to the last click across channels, and across platforms.\n\n\nFor example, if a customer clicks a Branch email link, and then clicks an ad, installs the the app and purchases an item, Branch will attribute the install and the purchase to the last clicked ad link.\n\n\nIf the customer then goes on to purchase an item on web within the attribution window, Branch will also attribute the web purchase to the same ad link, connecting the web and app actions taken by a single user for a more accurate view of your marketing channels and customer behavior.\n\n\n\n\nYou can read more about \nPeople-Based Attribution here\n.\n\n\nView-Through Attribution\n\n\nIf you'd like to try our view-through attribution beta, please contact \n.\n\n\nView-through attribution allows you to track installs, session starts and conversion events back to an ad, even if the ad was never clicked on. \n\n\nOur view-through attribution logic is currently as follows for any given event.\n\n\n\n\nIf there's a click within a valid attribution window, give credit to the click.\n\n\nIf there's no click within a valid attribution window, give credit to the last impression that was within a valid attribution window.\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, impression pixels are only supported with server to server tracking, so server to server macros and device IDs are required when using impression pixels.\n\n\nTo create a pixel, simply \ncreate an ad link\n, and grab the pixel from the final step of link creation.\n\n\nAdvanced\n\n\nAdd more postbacks\n\n\nWhen you enable an ad partner, your ad partner postbacks can be found under the \nPostbacks\n tab for that ad partner. It's easy to add additional postbacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the \nAdd New Postback\n button at the bottom of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA modal will appear with Branch default events, as well as any commerce or custom events you've set up. Select an event, enter a postback URL if you're asked to, and click \nSave\n. This will be the event that triggers your new postback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit postbacks\n\n\nFor advanced integrations, you may want to provide additional information in your postback that isn't there by default. You can edit postbacks by adding data into the textbox, then clicking save. When the postback is saved, it is then validated - if you enter an invalid postback, you'll get an error at the top of your screen.\n\n\n\n\nReset Postbacks\n\n\nWe all make mistakes from time to time. If you need to reset your postbacks and your credentials, navigate to the \nAccount Settings\n tab and look for the \nReset all settings\n button. Be careful though! This will disable the ad partner, clear out all credentials and postbacks that you've set up, and return the ad partner to its basic configuration. You can then start afresh.\n\n\n\n\nChange attribution windows\n\n\nAttribution windows can be specified at the global account level or on a per link basis with the link level window taking priority. See the below instructions for setup.\n\n\nFor customer experience and data accuracy, please do not set your deep linking window longer than the other attribution windows.\n\n\nAccount Level Attribution Windows\n\n\nYou can edit your attribution windows under Link Settings \n Attribution Windows.\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about account level attribution windows in \nPeople-Based Attribution\n.\n\n\nLink Level Attribution Windows\n\n\nTo set attribution windows on a link level, you can append the following parameters to your generated Branch link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\nExample Link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$click_install_window_days\n\n\nhttps://branchster.app.link/hpNVE52gxE?$click_install_window_days=3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$click_session_start_window_days\n\n\nhttps://branchster.app.link/hpNVE52gxE?$click_session_start_window_days=7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$click_conversion_window_days\n\n\nhttps://branchster.app.link/hpNVE52gxE?$click_session_start_window_days=30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$impression_install_window_days\n\n\nhttps://branchster.app.link/hpNVE52gxE?$impression_install_window_days=3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$impression_session_start_window_days\n\n\nhttps://branchster.app.link/hpNVE52gxE?$impression_session_start_window_days=1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$impression_conversion_window_days\n\n\nhttps://branchster.app.link/hpNVE52gxE?$impression_session_start_window_days=7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLink Level Attribution Support for Standard Branch links\n\n\nAs of July 2017, link level attribution window setting is only available on standard Branch links.

Please keep note of it.\n\n\n\n\nGrab Server to Server Token\n\n\nOnce you've captured the advertiser ID and selected the advertiser, navigate to \nFloodlight Configuration\n. From there, go to \"server to server\", and make sure \"in-app attribution tracking\" is check-marked. Click new token, call it \u201cBranch token\u201d, and save it. Copy this value, as well.\n\n\n\n\nNow that you have \nAdvertiser ID\n and \nServer to Server Token\n, the last step is to find the events you need to track.\n\n\nGrab Tags for Events\n\n\nGo to the \nFloodlight activities\n tab. For all the events you want to track, grab the \nActivity tag String\n and \nGroup tag String\n.\n\n\n\n\nIn the above screenshot, the two values for \nActivity tag String\n are \nact-ios\n and \nact-android\n. The one value for \nGroup tag String\n is \nsales\n. Do this for all activities you want to track.\n\n\nOnce you're done with this exercise, you should have at least 4 unique values:\n\n\n\n\nServer to Server token\n\n\nAdvertiser ID\n\n\nActivity tag String (per event)\n\n\nGroup tag String (per event)\n\n\n\n\nBranch Dashboard Setup\n\n\nLet's take these values and place them in Branch's dashboard. Begin by navigating to the \npartners page\n.\n\n\nEnable\n\n\nFind doubleclick in the search box. Hit enable. In the \nAccount Settings\n tab, insert your \nServer to Server token\n.\n\n\nMap Events\n\n\nAt this point, you have enabled Branch to communicate with Doubleclick. Now we need to map Branch events to \nFloodlight Activities\n found on the Doubleclick dashboard. Click the \nPostback Config\n tab. You should see a URL for the event \nInstall\n. For demonstration purposes, we will assume you have a corresponding Install event on the Doubleclick dashboard, but this applies to any event you add.\n\n\nStart by grabbing your \nAdvertiser ID\n, \nActivity tag String\n, and \nGroup tag String\n.\n\n\nIn the screenshot above, we have two events, \"In App Activations - Android\", and \"In App Activations - iOS\", which correspond to the Branch Install event. For this example, the \nActivity tag Strings\n are \nact-and\n and \nact-ios\n. The \nGroup tag String\n is \nsales\n.\n\n\nCopy the existing URL in Install, and replace the \nsrc\n, \ncat\n, and \ntype\n variables. Your end result should look exactly like this:\n\n\nhttps://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/s2s/appactivity/src=6637276;cat=\n#if user_data.os==\"IOS\"\nact-ios\n/#if\n#if user_data.os==\"ANDROID\"\nact-and\n/#if\n;type=sales;ord=${ (id)! }\n\n\nIf you don't have two different tags for iOS and Android, then it will look simpler:\n\n\nhttps://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/s2s/appactivity/src=6637276;cat=act-tag;type=sales;ord=${ (id)! }\n\n\n\n\nSimply update and hit save.\n\n\nRun campaigns\n\n\nAt this point, you can now create a link for the Doubleclick network and send data back.

If you are using the old experience, be sure to switch to the new experience.\n\n\nOnce you have completed set up below, you will be able to track Universal App Campaigns and forward events to AdWords for optimization. You will also be able to create links for non Universal App Install campaigns on AdWords.\n\n\nIn all cases, Branch will forward in-app events to AdWords for campaign optimization. In addition, Branch will receive attribution data for rich analysis in the Branch dashboard.\n\n\nSetup\n\n\nBefore you begin, be sure the following is confirmed.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, the Branch SDK must be integrated into your app, for both iOS and Android. \n\n\nYou must also collect the IDFA on iOS, or the AAID on Android. For specifics, refer to the set up guide for \niOS\n and \nAndroid\n respectively.\n\n\nMake sure to track all necessary events through the SDKs, with instructions \nhere\n\n\n\n\nYou must also have admin access to your AdWords account. You will generate Link IDs in AdWords.\n\n\nOAuth\n\n\nThe first step is connecting Branch \n AdWords together. By connecting these accounts, Branch will have read-only access to import click and impression data at the aggregate level. This will also let Branch track metrics across your different AdWords accounts, which means your manager (MCC) and children accounts.\n\n\nIt is not necessary to connect all AdWords accounts. However, you must connect the AdWords account that owns in-app conversions for your mobile app. Often, this is the MCC account.\n\n\nOAuth AdWords Setup\n\n\n\n\nLog in to your \nAdWords dashboard\n account that has the highest level of access. You will have the ability to connect all your AdWords accounts with Branch.\n\n\nGo to \nSettings \n Linked Accounts\n.\n\n\n\nCreate a new link ID: Go to \nThird Party App Analytics \n +\n.\n\n\nAdd a new provider: Select \"other\" in the drop down. Input the following ID: \n3404357870\n.\n\n\nSelect iOS or Android.\n\n\nCreate Link IDs for all platforms you run campaigns on.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n you must be an admin in your AdWords account in order to generate Link IDs!\n\n\nStore these Link IDs for easy access. The next step requires you to input them.\n\n\nOAuth Branch Setup\n\n\nOnce you're done with AdWords, navigate to the \npartner management\n tab and click \nConnect with Google\n. Choose the email address that is tied to the AdWords accounts you want to connect.\n\n\n\n\nSelect all the necessary accounts, and continue.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, paste the Link IDs from earlier.\n\n\n\n\nSet Attribution Windows (Optional)\n\n\nAfter you hit save, go to your \nlink settings\n, and navigate to Attribution Windows.\n\n\nIt is \nrecommended\n you match your attribution windows with Google's, but not required.\n\n\nFor example, if a user clicked an ad 8 days ago, and Google claims credit, we would \nnot\n count attribution, because our default is 7 days from click. However, it is ultimately up to you which attribution window you would like to use. Below is simply a \nrecommendation\n:\n\n\n\n\nClick to Install : 30 days\n\n\nClick to Conversion Event : 90 days\n\n\nClick to Open : 90 days\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will soon support the ability to have a conversion window for Google itself, so you don't have to modify your app level attribution window.\n\n\nImport Events In AdWords\n\n\nAll that remains is importing Branch events into AdWords. After you have set both Branch \n AdWords up, wait ~20 minutes, and go back to the AdWords dashboard. You can expedite this process if you open your app and simulate the events you want forwarded. Navigate back to the AdWords dashboard.\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nConversions\n.\n\n\n\nAdd a new conversion: \n+ \n App \n Third Party App Analytics\n.\n\n\n\nImport your Branch specific events. Click \nImport and Continue\n.\n\n\nMark \nInclude in Conversions\n to \nYES\n.\n\n\n\n\nThat's it! All of your campaigns with mobile conversions will be tracked in Branch's dashboard. You can now track as many Universal App Campaigns as you want, automatically.\n\n\nMigration\n\n\nYou may have onboarded to Branch using the old style of AdWords. If you have ever used conversion IDs, conversion labels, or postback URLs, then this applies to you. Read this section below to learn what has changed, and what steps you may need to take to remove legacy information. Be sure to complete the set up listed above before going through this guide.\n\n\nWhat Changed\n\n\nWhile AdWords got a user experience change, it also deprecated the old functionality of conversion IDs and labels. As such, the new AdWords experience does not give you the option to enable conversion events using postback URLs. This means the only way to track AdWords campaigns using the new interface (Universal App Campaigns + search, display, video) is to connect via OAuth, as outlined above.\n\n\nYou can confirm if you are on the new experience if your AdWords user interface looks like the image below:\n\n\n\n\nAdWords also removed the old App Install campaigns, as they have been superceded by Universal App Campaigns. \nYou can only track app install campaigns in AdWords using Universal App Campaigns\n. This includes search, display, and video install ads, rolled into one campaign type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Campaign\n\n\nUses Tracking Link\n\n\nGoogle Status\n\n\nBranch Status\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Install Ads\n\n\nYes\n\n\nRemoved\n\n\nRemoved support\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Install Ads\n\n\nYes\n\n\nRemoved\n\n\nRemoved support\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo Install Ads\n\n\nYes\n\n\nRemoved\n\n\nRemoved support\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversal App Campaigns\n\n\nNo\n\n\nActive\n\n\nActive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch Ads\n\n\nYes\n\n\nActive\n\n\nActive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Ads\n\n\nYes\n\n\nActive\n\n\nActive\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp Engagement Ads\n\n\nYes\n\n\nActive\n\n\nActive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs such, tracking links only work in non-app install ads. Universal App Campaigns will not return deep link data when the app is installed and opened. However, if you rely on this data to make it back to your own systems, you can set a webhook up.\n\n\nRemove Conversions From Adwords\n\n\nThe first step of migrating from the old AdWords experience to the new is removing conversions events from AdWords. Go to your conversions in AdWords, and find all events created by Branch. If they contain a postback URL, either mark \"Include in conversions\" as \nNO\n, or simply remove / delete them. Example below:\n\n\n\n\nYour new events will \nnot\n contain a box for Postback URL. They will also contain a field called \nAnalytics Provider\n, which will say Branch. Example below:\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have removed old conversions from AdWords, you will go to Branch's dashboard.\n\n\nRemove Conversions From Branch\n\n\nThere are two places you should remove conversion IDs and labels from. The first is a legacy option that may not be available on your dashboard anymore. If it isn't, then simply ignore that step.\n\n\nRemove From Link Settings\n\n\nThis is a legacy option that may not be on your dashboard. If it isn't, then go to the step below.\n\n\nNavigate to this section of your \ndashboard\n, and remove all entries under \nGoogle Ads Conversions\n. Hit save.\n\n\nRemove From Ads Partner Manager\n\n\nGo to this \nsection\n of the Branch dashboard. Remove all fields found here.\n\n\nNext, click \nPostback Config\n, and uncheck all the checkboxes. Hit save.\n\n\nThe new integration will automatically forward events without you having to configure postbacks for each. Check \nthe section\n to learn how we do this.\n\n\nYou can safely ignore all links created using the old integration. You're done!\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\nIf you're wondering why we're asking you to migrate from the legacy system to the new system, there are a handful of benefits you should know.\n\n\nFirst, Branch had limitations using this old method of tracking. Those included being able to track 1 Universal App Campaign per platform, and receiving very limited data in the Branch dashboard.\n\n\nWith the new integration, we can now track all your Universal App Campaigns.\n\n\nWe can also forward data from AdWords' dashboard into Branch. This means campaign name, channels the ad was displayed on, and more are visible in the Branch dashboard.\n\n\nData Mapping\n\n\nBranch maps the following data fields from AdWords to Branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Data\n\n\nBranch Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampaign ID\n\n\n~campaign_id\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampaign Name\n\n\n~campaign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nad_type\n\n\n~ad_type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnetwork_type\n\n\n~channel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnetwork_subtype\n\n\n~secondary_publisher\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForward Events to AdWords\n\n\nOnce you begin tracking events through the Branch SDK, you can select which events to import in AdWords. AdWords has pre-defined events that map to pre-defined Branch events, listed below. Reference this \ndoc\n for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Event\n\n\nBranch Event\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfirst_open\n\n\ninstall\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsession_start\n\n\nopen\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin_app_purchase\n\n\npurchase\n\n\n\n\n\n\nview_item_list\n\n\nview_items\n\n\n\n\n\n\nview_item\n\n\nview_item\n\n\n\n\n\n\nview_search_results\n\n\nsearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadd_to_cart\n\n\nadd_to_cart\n\n\n\n\n\n\necommerce_purchase\n\n\npurchase\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncustom\n\n\nany custom event tracked through Branch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to track these events, please refer to this document for further \ninformation\n. \n\n\nOther Campaigns\n\n\nThe above guide covered what was necessary to track Universal App Campaigns.

Go to \nLink Settings\n, and navigate down to the Attribution Windows section. Here, you should set the attribution window for \nclick to install\n, \nclick to session start\n, and \nclick to conversion event\n to be 30, 90, and 90 days respectively. This aligns with Google's default attribution windows, but if you'd like to make them shorter, feel free.\n\n\nAnother source of discrepancies is the fact that attribution is based upon \nclick\n time in AdWords, whereas it is based upon \ninstall\n time in the Branch dashboard. This isn't a discrepancy per se, but will sometimes show different numbers in the two dashboards.\n\n\nFinally, AdWords can delay reporting up to 24 hours. It's best to measure campaigns in a trailing manner.\n\n\nQ: My campaign is reporting a number of conversions much higher than the number of conversions shown in the conversion table in Adwords\n\n\nA:\n When viewing a campaign, it shows the sum of all conversion events that apply to it. To view by conversion, navigate to \nSegment\n \n \nConversions\n \n \nConversion name\n, in order to clearly see the breakdown of your campaign's conversions.",

The first thing to do is to make sure your attribution window in Branch lines up with Google. Go to  Link Settings , and navigate down to the Attribution Windows section. Here, you should set the attribution window for  click to install ,  click to session start , and  click to conversion event  to be 30, 90, and 90 days respectively. This aligns with Google's default attribution windows, but if you'd like to make them shorter, feel free.  Another source of discrepancies is the fact that attribution is based upon  click  time in AdWords, whereas it is based upon  install  time in the Branch dashboard. This isn't a discrepancy per se, but will sometimes show different numbers in the two dashboards.  Finally, AdWords can delay reporting up to 24 hours. It's best to measure campaigns in a trailing manner.  Q: My campaign is reporting a number of conversions much higher than the number of conversions shown in the conversion table in Adwords  A:  When viewing a campaign, it shows the sum of all conversion events that apply to it.

You will need access to your app code to make these changes.\n\n\nYou should have \nreceived an email from Branch\n with your ESP's click tracking domain. If not, likely you or someone on your team still needs to complete the \nDeep Linked Email setup flow\n.\n\n\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n\nApple recognizes the click tracking domain as a Universal Link, and opens the app immediately without the browser opening. Once the app has opened, Branch will collect the referring URL that opened the app (at this time, it will be the click tracking url). Inside the app, Branch will robotically \u201cclick\u201d the link, registering the click with the ESP, and returning the Branch link information to the Branch SDK inside the app. This information is then used to deep link the user to the correct in-app content. See the \nSupport\n section for more information.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a custom click tracking domain\n\n\nAdd and verify an email domain in the \nDomains\n section of your Amazon SES account:\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on how to set up a click tracking domain please visit Amazon SES's \ndocumentation\n.\n\n\nSet up your click tracking domain\n\n\nCreate a CNAME for your click tracking domain and point it to \nthirdparty.bnc.lt\n.\n\n\nAdd your click tracking domain to your Associated Domains\n\n\nTo enable Universal Links on your click tracking domain, you'll need to add the click tracking domain to your Associated Domains entitlement.\n\n\n\n\nIn Xcode, go to the \nCapabilities\n tab of your project file.\n\n\n\n\nScroll down and enable \nAssociated Domains\n if it is not already enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy your click tracking domain from the \nemail you received from Branch\n, or retrieve it from your ESP's settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nDomains\n section, click the \n+\n icon and add your click tracking domain. For example, if your click tracking domain is \nemail.example.com\n, add an entry for \napplinks:email.example.com\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving trouble or new to Universal Links?\n\n\nFollow \nthese instructions\n for more details on enabling Universal Links in the Branch dashboard and in Xcode.\n\n\n\n\nHandle links for web-only content\n\n\nIf you have links to content that exists only on web, and not in the app (for example, a temporary marketing webpage that isn't in the app) then this code snippet will ensure all links that have not had the deep linking script applied will open in a browser.\n\n\nYou should add this code snippet inside the deep link handler code block. Note that this uses query parameter \n$web_only=true\n. This should match the \nquery parameter on the web URL\n you enter in the email.\n\n\n[\nbranch\n \ninitSessionWithLaunchOptions\n:\nlaunchOptions\n \nandRegisterDeepLinkHandler\n:\n^\n(\nNSDictionary\n \n*\nparams\n,\n \nNSError\n \n*\nerror\n)\n \n{\n\n  \n// params are the deep linked params associated with the link that the user clicked before showing up.\n\n  \nif\n \n(\nparams\n[\n@\n$3p\n]\n \n \nparams\n[\n@\n$web_only\n])\n \n{\n\n            \nNSURL\n \n*\nurl\n \n=\n \n[\nNSURL\n \nURLWithString\n:\nparams\n[\n@\n$original_url\n]];\n\n            \nif\n \n(\nurl\n)\n \n{\n\n                \n[\napplication\n \nopenURL\n:\nurl\n];\n \n// check to make sure your existing deep linking logic, if any, is not executed, perhaps by returning early\n\n            \n}\n\n  \n}\n \nelse\n \n{\n \n    \n// it is a deep link\n\n    \nGDLog\n(\n@\nbranch deep link: %@\n,\n \n[\nparams\n \ndescription\n]);\n \n    \n[\nself\n \nhandleBranchDeeplink\n:\nparams\n];\n\n  \n}\n\n\n}];\n\n\n\n\n\nValidate and test\n\n\n\n\nThe last step of the \nDeep Linked Email setup flow\n validates whether you have completed all necessary steps and whether an engineer on your team has completed the \ntechnical setup\n steps.

We recommend creating a new click tracking domain for the Epsilon Harmony integration. You can switch over your production click tracking domain to Epsilon but we recommend testing with a different domain to get started.\n\n\nFor Epsilon, you may also need an IP address. Notify your Epsilon Harmony Account Manager that you plan to use Branch Deep Linked Email, and ask your Harmony Account Manager to provide the IP that you set your click tracking domains to. Add that next to your click tracking domain in this step.\n\n\nOn \nDone\n click, an AASA file - required for Universal Links - specific to that domain will be generated.\n\n\nConfigure your app for your click tracking domain\n\n\n\n\nIn this prompt, enter the email of someone on your team who is qualified to modify your iOS app, and then click \nSend\n.

Once the app has opened, Branch will collect the referring URL that opened the app (at this time, it will be the click tracking url). Inside the app, Branch will robotically \u201cclick\u201d the link, registering the click with the ESP, and returning the Branch link information to the Branch SDK inside the app. This information is then used to deep link the user to the correct in-app content. See the \nSupport\n section for more information.\n\n\n\n\nSet up your click tracking domain\n\n\nOnly do this step after you've \nprovided your click tracking domain\n to Branch.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a CNAME for your subdomain and point it to \nepsilon.thirdparty.bnc.lt\n\n\nConfirm with your Branch Account Manager that the domain is working correctly.\n\n\n\n\nAdd your click tracking domain to your Associated Domains\n\n\nTo enable Universal Links on your click tracking domain, you'll need to add the click tracking domain to your Associated Domains entitlement.\n\n\n\n\nIn Xcode, go to the \nCapabilities\n tab of your project file.\n\n\n\n\nScroll down and enable \nAssociated Domains\n if it is not already enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy your click tracking domain from the \nemail you received from Branch\n, or retrieve it from your ESP's settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nDomains\n section, click the \n+\n icon and add your click tracking domain.

You will need to replace the web URLs in your templates with these. To create Branch links, you can either:\n\n\n\n\nUse the Branch Responsys SDK\n\n\nMaking regular Branch links compatible with email\n\n\nCreate email links via API without changing your email templates\n\n\nConvert all web links in your email to deep links\n\n\n\n\nResponsys uses the shortcode \ne_rs\n for links in emails\n - please use this in place of \ne_xx\n in the guide below.\n\n\nUse the Branch Responsys SDK\n\n\nIn this step, we'll upload an SDK that makes it very easy to create deep links in your emails.  Please remember that this will require an EMD (Email Message Designer) enabled account.\n\n\n\n\nWatch how to do this instead\n\n\nThere is also a \ntutorial video\n that walks through these steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork with your Branch account manager to modify the following code snippet, replacing \nDOMAIN-HERE\n with your Branch base domain:\n\n\n#macro deeplink link_to_be_wrapped\n#assign branch_base_url=\nhttps://DOMAIN-HERE/3p?%243p=e_rs\n#assign final_link=branch_base_url + \n%24original_url=\n + link_to_be_wrapped?url(\nISO-8859-1\n)\na\n \nhref=\n${\nfinal_link\n}\n#nested\n/a\n/#macro\n \n#macro tracked_deeplink link_to_be_wrapped\n#assign branch_base_url=\nhttps://DOMAIN-HERE/3p?%243p=e_rs\n#assign deeplink=branch_base_url + \n%24original_url=\n + link_to_be_wrapped?url(\nISO-8859-1\n)\n/#macro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog in to your Responsys account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Responsys Dashboard, open your Content Library. You can also access it via the Shortcuts screen on the main page: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you are in the Content Manager, you\u2019ll see a list of folders where content is stored. Under \nAll Content\n, create a new folder named \nBranch_SDK\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the \nBranch_SDK\n folder and then click \nCreate Document\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Create Document window:\n\n\n\n\nEnter \nbranch-sdk\n in the \u201cDocument Name\u201d field.\n\n\nIn the \nContent Box\n, delete all the text.\n\n\nPaste the snippet you copied in \n1\n.\n\n\nClick Save. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have now successfully created the deep linking script. Your file structure should look as follows:\n\n\n\n\nConfigure your Responsys email templates\n\n\nThis code is referred to as the \"Branch script\" - this script will convert your web URLs to deep links.\n\n\nThe Responsys integration requires you to add email template code in two places.\n\n\n\n\nAt the top of an email template\n\n\nImmediately before a hyperlink\n\n\n\n\nCopy the following snippet, and using the \u201cSource\u201d view, paste the snippet directly under the \nhtml\n tag for every template you plan to add deep linking to.\n\n\n#include \ncms://contentlibrary/Branch_SDK/branch-sdk.htm\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate deep links\n\n\nWherever you are using \na\n tags in your email templates, replace those with \n@deeplink\n tags, or add \n@tracked_deeplink /\n for web URLs that you would like to deep link.\n\n\nHere's how it looks with Link Tracking disabled.\n\n\nBefore:\n\n\na href=\"https://branch.io\"\nExample link\n/a\n\n\nAfter:\n\n\n@deeplink \"https://branch.io\"\nExample link\n/@deeplink\n\n\nWith link tracking enabled, you can still use Branch links in emails.\n\n\nBefore:\n\n\na href=\"https://branch.io/product/1234\"\nExample link\n/a\n\n\nAfter:\n\n\n@tracked_deeplink \"https://branch.io/product/1234\" /\n\n\na href=\"${clickthrough('TEST_TRACKED_DEEPLINK' , 'deeplink=' + deeplink)}\"\nExample link\n/a\n\n\nThis latter example pulls from a Link Table.\n\n\n\n\nMaking regular Branch links compatible with email\n\n\nBe sure to add \n\"$3p\":\"e_xx\"\n to the deep link data of any links you use in email to ensure Universal Link and click tracking works as expected.\n\n\nCreate email links via API without changing your email templates\n\n\nTo create email links via API, please use the instructions on how to \ncreate links via API\n, but include the following key value pairs in your call:\n\n\n\n\n\"$3p\":\"e_xx\"\n This is required for Universal Link and click tracking functionality.\n\n\n\"$original_url\":\"{{your web url URI encoded}}\"\n For each piece of content, include a URI encoded version of your content's web URL. You can also add deep link data as query parameters on that web URL. This ensures accurate Content Analytics reporting. \n   \nExample:\n \n\"$original_url\":\"https%3A%2F%2Fshop.com%2Fshoes%2Fbrown-shoes%3Fmy_key%3Dmy_value%26campaign%3Dshoe_discounts\"\n\n\n\n\nConvert all web links in your email to deep links\n\n\nWe have provided a way of easily converting web links to Branch links, as well as \nan example\n. The example takes an html email (as a string) and applies the script to it.\n\n\nHere is the script:\n\n\nvar\n \ncrypto\n \n=\n \nrequire\n(\ncrypto\n);\n\n\nmodule\n.\nexports\n \n=\n \nfunction\n(\noriginal_url\n,\n \nbranch_base_url\n)\n \n{\n\n    \nif\n \n(\n!\noriginal_url\n)\n \n{\n \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nError\n(\nMissing original_url\n);\n \n}\n\n    \nif\n \n(\ntypeof\n \noriginal_url\n \n!=\n \nstring\n)\n \n{\n \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nError\n(\nInvalid original_url\n);\n \n}\n\n    \nif\n \n(\n!\nbranch_base_url\n)\n \n{\n \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nError\n(\nMissing branch_base_url, should be similar to https://bnc.lt/abcd/3p?%243p=e_xx\n);\n \n}\n\n    \nif\n \n(\ntypeof\n \nbranch_base_url\n \n!=\n \nstring\n)\n \n{\n \nreturn\n \nnew\n \nError\n(\nInvalid branch_base_url\n);\n \n}\n\n\n    \nreturn\n \nbranch_base_url\n \n+\n \n%24original_url=\n \n+\n \nencodeURIComponent\n(\noriginal_url\n);\n\n\n};\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is how links look before and after (the latter being a Branch deep link).\n\n\n\n\nBefore:\n \nhttp://example.com/?foo=bar\n\n\nAfter:\n \nhttps://vza3.app.link/3p?%243p=e_xx\n%24original_url=http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%3Ffoo%3Dbar\n\n\n\n\nNote\n that these are simplified examples, not actual demo links.\n\n\nHandle links for web-only content\n\n\nIn some cases you may have content on web that isn\u2019t in the app - for example, a temporary Mother\u2019s Day promotion or an unsubscribe button. You can designate links to only open on web if you use the Responsys Link Table feature. There are three URL fields in the link table when creating a new link: \nLINK_URL\n, \nIOS_LINK_URL\n, and \nANDROID_LINK_URL\n. If you only enter the link in the \nLINK_URL\n field, the path of the final click-wrapped url will begin with \n/pub/cc\n.

You will need to replace the web URLs in your templates with these. To create Branch links, you can either:\n\n\n\n\nAutomatically populate emails with content via Zephyr\n\n\nMaking regular Branch links compatible with email\n\n\nCreate email links via API without changing your email templates\n\n\nConvert all web links in your email to deep links\n\n\n\n\nAutomatically populate emails with content via Zephyr\n\n\nSailthru allows you to automatically populate emails with content via Zephyr. This means that you can create a template once, then have all subsequent emails automatically configured to convert normal web URLs into deep links.\n\n\nThe Sailthru integration requires you to add code in two places:\n\n\n\n\nAt the top of an email template\n\n\nImmediately before a hyperlink\n\n\n\n\nPrepare your template\n\n\nAt the top of each email template, you should simply copy and paste the following snippet.

On \nDone\n click, an AASA file - required for Universal Links - specific to that domain will be generated.\n\n\nConfigure your app for your click tracking domain\n\n\n\n\nIn this prompt, enter the email of someone on your team who is qualified to modify your iOS app, and then click \nSend\n. They will complete the \ntechnical setup\n steps below.\n\n\nTechnical setup\n\n\nThe following app changes ensure that your email integration supports \nUniversal Links\n. You will need access to your app code to make these changes.\n\n\nYou should have \nreceived an email from Branch\n with your ESP's click tracking domain. If not, likely you or someone on your team still needs to complete the \nDeep Linked Email setup flow\n.\n\n\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n\nApple recognizes the click tracking domain as a Universal Link, and opens the app immediately without the browser opening. Once the app has opened, Branch will collect the referring URL that opened the app (at this time, it will be the click tracking url). Inside the app, Branch will robotically \u201cclick\u201d the link, registering the click with the ESP, and returning the Branch link information to the Branch SDK inside the app. This information is then used to deep link the user to the correct in-app content. See the \nSupport\n section for more information.\n\n\n\n\nSet up your click tracking domain\n\n\nCreate a CNAME for your click tracking domain and point it to \nthirdparty.bnc.lt\n.\n\n\nAdd your click tracking domain to your Associated Domains\n\n\nTo enable Universal Links on your click tracking domain, you'll need to add the click tracking domain to your Associated Domains entitlement.\n\n\n\n\nIn Xcode, go to the \nCapabilities\n tab of your project file.\n\n\n\n\nScroll down and enable \nAssociated Domains\n if it is not already enabled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy your click tracking domain from the \nemail you received from Branch\n, or retrieve it from your ESP's settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nDomains\n section, click the \n+\n icon and add your click tracking domain.

Once in the browser, the click tracking redirect will happen, followed by an instant redirect to the Branch link. At this point, Branch will either stay in the browser, and load the original URL (if the app is not installed, or the customer is on a desktop device), or Branch will open the app and deep link to content. Branch uses the information from the original URL to deep link to the correct in-app content.\n\n\n\n\nUniversal links and click tracking\n\n\nApple introduced Universal Links starting with iOS 9. Apple introduced Universal Links starting with iOS 9. You must configure your app and your links in a specific way to enable Universal Link functionality. Branch guides developers through this process so that Branch links function as Universal Links.\n\n\nFor Universal Links to work, Apple requires that a file called an \u201cApple-App-Site-Association\u201d (AASA) file must be hosted on the domain of the link in question. When the link is clicked, Apple will check for the presence of this file to decide whether or not to open the app. All Branch links are Universal Links, because we will host this file securely on your Branch link domain.\n\n\nWhen you click a Branch link directly from an email inside the Mail app on iOS 9+, it functions as a Universal Link - it redirects directly into the desired app. However, if you put a Branch Universal Link behind a click tracking URL, it won\u2019t deep link into the app. This is because generally, a click tracking URL is not a Universal Link. If you\u2019re not hosting that AASA file on the click tracking URL\u2019s domain, you aren\u2019t going to get Universal Link behavior for that link.\n\n\nSolution\n\n\nTo solve this, Branch will host the AASA file on your click tracking domain.

This project is formally called Firebase App Indexing.\n\n\nAt a high level, App Indexing has two themes to consider.\n\n\n\n\nResults, ranking and relevancy are based upon web scraping. App Indexing does not improve relevancy in results.\n\n\nApp Indexing makes it so that web results \nalso\n open up your app.\n\n\n\n\nWhen enabling App Indexing, you will likely want to make these changes to your website, as well:\n\n\n\n\nMake your existing website support Apple's Universal Links and Android's App Links. After this, all of your links will correctly open the app and you're done.\n\n\nAdd the undocumented header \nlink rel=\"alternate\" ..\n tags to your website for when Google crawls the page. Branch can assist with this using \nautoAppIndex()\n, documented below.\n\n\n\n\nIf Google knows your website opens the app, when it shows up in a search result, and the user has the app installed, the app will open instead of the website, therefore achieveing App Indexing results in organic search portals.\n\n\nBranch's App Indexing integration is designed for businesses that don't have a website, and want Branch to host their site for them. If you have a website, Branch can dynamically inject App Indexing tags through the WebSDK function \nautoAppIndex()\n described \nhere\n.\n\n\nNote that in order for you to get traffic from this feature, your Branch link will need to appear in search results. We've just now supercharged our app indexing feature with AMP tech to leverage Google's new prioritization of these pages.\n\n\nSetup\n\n\nDefine Your Content\n\n\nThe first step to listing your app content in Google is to tell Branch what the content is and how it should appear in search. Assuming you followed our get started guide, you have already indexed your content by creating \nBranch Universal Objects\n. You can create these objects using the native SDKs, where you simply need to set the OG tag parameters.

            "text": "Google's App Indexing is a project that attempts to expose app results in Google searches performed on mobile devices. This project is formally called Firebase App Indexing.  At a high level, App Indexing has two themes to consider.   Results, ranking and relevancy are based upon web scraping. App Indexing does not improve relevancy in results.  App Indexing makes it so that web results  also  open up your app.   When enabling App Indexing, you will likely want to make these changes to your website, as well:   Make your existing website support Apple's Universal Links and Android's App Links. After this, all of your links will correctly open the app and you're done.  Add the undocumented header  link rel=\"alternate\" ..  tags to your website for when Google crawls the page. Branch can assist with this using  autoAppIndex() , documented below.   If Google knows your website opens the app, when it shows up in a search result, and the user has the app installed, the app will open instead of the website, therefore achieveing App Indexing results in organic search portals.  Branch's App Indexing integration is designed for businesses that don't have a website, and want Branch to host their site for them. If you have a website, Branch can dynamically inject App Indexing tags through the WebSDK function  autoAppIndex()  described  here .  Note that in order for you to get traffic from this feature, your Branch link will need to appear in search results. We've just now supercharged our app indexing feature with AMP tech to leverage Google's new prioritization of these pages.",

You can encourage this by making it easy to generate sharing links that open your app \nand\n route back exactly to the piece of content that was originally shared. This will even work when the user who opens the link doesn't have your app installed yet.\n\n\nGuide\n\n\nLet's say you have developed an app called \nBranch Monster Factory\n. You want your users to share the monsters they create with their friends, and see the monster that was shared as soon as your app opens. Let's get started!\n\n\nGenerate shareable links\n\n\nThe first thing we need to do is allow your users to create links. These links will contain references to the content being shared, which generate analytics data and allow your app to route straight back to that content when a link is opened.\n\n\nStart by importing the relevant Branch frameworks into the view controller you will be using:\n\n\n\n\n\n\niOS - Objective C\n\n\n#import \nBranchUniversalObject.h\n\n\n#import \nBranchLinkProperties.h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niOS - Swift\n\n\n{\n%\n \nhighlight\n \nobjective\n-\nc\n \n%\n}\n\n\n#import \nBranchUniversalObject.h\n\n\n#import \nBranchLinkProperties.h\n\n\n#import \nBranchConstants.h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a \nBranchUniversalObject\n containing details about the content that is being shared. You can find examples for the \nother platforms here\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\niOS - Objective C\n\n\nBranchUniversalObject\n \n*\nbranchUniversalObject\n \n=\n \n[[\nBranchUniversalObject\n \nalloc\n]\n \ninitWithCanonicalIdentifier\n:\n@\nmonster/12345\n];\n\n\nbranchUniversalObject\n.\ntitle\n \n=\n \n@\nMeet Mr. Squiggles\n;\n\n\nbranchUniversalObject\n.\ncontentDescription\n \n=\n \n@\nYour friend Josh has invited you to meet his awesome monster, Mr. Squiggles!\n;\n\n\nbranchUniversalObject\n.\nimageUrl\n \n=\n \n@\nhttps://example.com/monster-pic-12345.png\n;\n\n\n[\nbranchUniversalObject\n \naddMetadataKey\n:\n@\nuserId\n \nvalue\n:\n@\n12345\n];\n\n\n[\nbranchUniversalObject\n \naddMetadataKey\n:\n@\nuserName\n \nvalue\n:\n@\nJosh\n];\n\n\n[\nbranchUniversalObject\n \naddMetadataKey\n:\n@\nmonsterName\n \nvalue\n:\n@\nMr. Squiggles\n];\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niOS - Swift\n\n\nlet\n \nbranchUniversalObject\n:\n \nBranchUniversalObject\n \n=\n \nBranchUniversalObject\n(\ncanonicalIdentifier\n:\n \nmonster/12345\n)\n\n\nbranchUniversalObject\n.\ntitle\n \n=\n \nMeet Mr. Squiggles\n\n\nbranchUniversalObject\n.\ncontentDescription\n \n=\n \nYour friend Josh has invited you to meet his awesome monster, Mr. Squiggles!\n\n\nbranchUniversalObject\n.\nimageUrl\n \n=\n \nhttps://example.com/monster-pic-12345.png\n\n\nbranchUniversalObject\n.\ncontentMetadata\n.\ncustomMetadata\n \n=\n \n[\ncustom\n:\n123\n]\n\n\nbranchUniversalObject\n.\ncontentMetadata\n.\ncustomMetadata\n \n=\n \n[\nanything\n:\neverything\n]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\n \nBranchUniversalObject\n \nbranchUniversalObject\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nBranchUniversalObject\n()\n\n                \n.\nsetCanonicalIdentifier\n(\nmonster/12345\n)\n\n                \n.\nsetTitle\n(\nMeet Mr. Squiggles\n)\n\n                \n.\nsetContentDescription\n(\nYour friend Josh has invited you to meet his awesome monster, Mr. Squiggles!\n)\n\n                \n.\nsetContentImageUrl\n(\nhttps://example.com/monster-pic-12345.png\n)\n\n                \n.\nsetContentMetadata\n(\nnew\n \nContentMetadata\n().\naddCustomMetadata\n(\nuserId\n,\n \n12345\n)\n\n                    \n.\naddCustomMetadata\n(\nuserName\n,\n \nJosh\n)\n\n                    \n.\naddCustomMetadata\n(\nmonsterName\n,\n \nMr. Squiggles\n));\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nThe \ncanonicalIdentifier\n or \ncanonicalUrl\n parameter greatly improves the content analytics data Branch captures. It should be unique to that piece of content and helps Branch dedupe across many instances of the same thing. Suitable options: a website with pathing, or a database with identifiers for entities.\n\n\n\n\nThen define the properties of the link. In the example, our properties reflect that this is shared content and the user selected Facebook as the destination. You can find examples of \nthe other platforms here\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\niOS - Objective C\n\n\nBranchLinkProperties\n \n*\nlinkProperties\n \n=\n \n[[\nBranchLinkProperties\n \nalloc\n]\n \ninit\n];\n\n\nlinkProperties\n.\nfeature\n \n=\n \n@\nshare\n;\n\n\nlinkProperties\n.\nchannel\n \n=\n \n@\nfacebook\n;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niOS - Swift\n\n\nlet\n \nlinkProperties\n:\n \nBranchLinkProperties\n \n=\n \nBranchLinkProperties\n()\n\n\nlinkProperties\n.\nfeature\n \n=\n \nshare\n\n\nlinkProperties\n.\nchannel\n \n=\n \nfacebook\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\nLinkProperties\n \nlinkProperties\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nLinkProperties\n()\n\n               \n.\nsetChannel\n(\nfacebook\n)\n\n               \n.\nsetFeature\n(\nsharing\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that on Android, you can customize the styling with the ShareSheetStyle class.

Reward rules can be based on both \nautomatic events and custom events\n.\n\n\n\n\nIdentify your users\n\n\nBecause we do not merge identities, you \nshould set rewards on custom events\n and \nnot use\n the events we automatically track (\ninstall\n and \nopen\n), and do so only \nafter\n you have identified a user using our \nidentity methods\n. This will help avoid duplicate rewards and missing credits.\n\n\n\n\nAwarding credits\n\n\n\n\nReferral Fraud Protection\n\n\nBranch tracks the hardware ID and IDFA of every device we detect, and ties these to our concept of a user identity. However, this means that you may run into issues if you test repeatedly with the same devices. When testing referral programs and reward rules, you should \nuse debug mode\n.\n\n\n\n\nTo add a rule, go to the Dashboard Referrals page and click the \nRules tab\n. Click the green \"+ Add a new rule\" button. Once there, you can select between two options:\n\n\nGive reward\n\n\nYou can automatically give awards based on events taken by users.\n\n\nProperties you can define:\n\n\n\n\nWho gets a reward\n\n\nHow many credits the reward is\n\n\nWhich \nbucket\n the credits go to\n\n\nWhether the reward occurs the first time or every time\n\n\nWhich event triggers the reward\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nLet's say you want to give 10 credits to each new user who signs up through a friend, and 5 credits to the friend who referred him or her. That can be done through a combination of two rules:\n\n\nRule 1: rewarding the referred user 10 credits\n\n\n\n\nWho gets a reward: \n\"Referred acting users\"\n\n\nHow many credits the reward is: \n10\n\n\nWhich bucket the credits go to: \ndefault\n\n\nWhether the reward occurs the first time or every time: \nthe first time\n\n\nWhich event triggers the reward: \ninstall\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule 2: rewarding the referring user 5 credits\n\n\n\n\nWho gets a reward: \n\"Referring users\"\n\n\nHow many credits the reward is: \n5\n\n\nWhich bucket the credits go to: \ndefault\n\n\nWhether the reward occurs the first time or every time: \nthe first time\n\n\nWhich event triggers the reward: \ninstall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewing Credits\n\n\nOnce users have credits, they should be able to redeem them.

            "text": "Overview\n\n\nAt the 2017 Google IO, Google launched the public version of Instant Apps for developers to adopt and build on. Instant Apps are a way to load a partial section (or \nsplit\n as Google refers to them), without the user having to visit the Play Store and install your app. In effect, it's instant access to your native app. If you have been using a website as a fallback when your full Android app is not installed, an Instant App is an alternative. You'll have to choose between mobile web and your Instant App on Android so make sure you plan out your integration!\n\n\nBranch has made it incredibly easy to start using your basic Branch links in your Instant Apps as shown below. The guide on this page will walk you through the full configuration process to enable Branch in your new Instant App.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis guide is not about how to configure your Android app to be an Instant App. Please see \nGoogle's documentation for detailed instructions\n on how to do this. Come back to this guide when you're ready to enable Branch.\n\n\n\n\nWhy use Branch for your Instant Apps\n\n\nIf you follow Google's guide, they'll have you integrate your own web links as Android App Links, that will trigger Instant Apps. What can Branch do for you then? First off, let me explain how Branch works with Instant Apps. Branch will act as a \nnew\n web domain that you'll register for Android App Links in addition to your own web domain or as your only domain in the manifest. We act as your link.\n\n\nHere's a list of the potential use cases for Branch links and Instant Apps:\n\n\n\n\nBranch will host personalized web links for you since we provision a custom domain (yourapp.app.link or whitelabeled) for every app. If you don't have a website, this means that we can take care of all your Android App Links needs, automatically configuring and hosting the assetlinks.json file on your behalf.\n\n\nIf you have a popular website and have configured Android App Links, you likely don't want 100% of your web links triggering your Instant App. Your Instant App will only support a fraction of your full app functionality. You can configure your Instant App to only trigger on your Branch link domains and paths, then use the usage of Branch to control when users are linked to Instant Apps.\n\n\nBranch can measure and attribute \nclicks\n, \ninstalls\n and custom conversion events back to the Branch tracking link for \nall visits to your Instant App\n, which are visible on the dashboard.\n\n\nYou can use Branch links to deferred deep link from the Android Instant App to the full Android App. You'll likely build a feature that pushes users from the Instant App to the full Android app, and Branch can do its magic on this transition.\n\n\nBranch can measure and attribute \nclicks\n, \ninstalls\n and custom conversion events inside your full native Android App for users who were referred from an Instant App, showing the conversion from click -\n Instant App -\n Full App on the dashboard.\n\n\n\n\nSetup\n\n\nIntegrating Branch for your Instant App\n\n\nSo you're convinced. Let's get started! If at any time, you need a real example, you can check out a \nfull demo application\n on our Github. We've replicated our \noriginal Android demo application\n and modified it to support Android Instant Apps.\n\n\nInitialize the Branch SDK\n\n\nHead to your \ncore library project\n, where your Application class is defined and drop in the snippet of code to the onCreate() method as follows. If you plan on deep linking from your Android Instant App to your full Android app after its installed, you'll need to add the line \nenablePlayStoreReferrer\n. This adds a delay to the initialization to wait for the Google Play Referrer, which can take up to a second.\n\n\npublic\n \nvoid\n \nonCreate\n()\n \n{\n\n  \nsuper\n.\nonCreate\n();\n\n  \n// This is needed to deferred deep link from an Android Instant App to a full app\n\n  \n// It tells the Branch initialization to wait for the Google Play Referrer before proceeding.\n\n  \nBranch\n.\nenablePlayStoreReferrer\n(\n1000L\n);\n\n\n  \n// Initialize the Branch SDK\n\n  \nBranch\n.\ngetAutoInstance\n(\nthis\n);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd your Branch keys and register for Install Referrer\n\n\nInstant Apps can be rather confusing as there are many different manifests, but you want to find the Manifest that contains your \napplication\n tags. Make sure your Application class name is defined here, and then specify the Branch keys \ninside\n the \napplication\n element.\n\n\napplication\n\n        \nandroid:allowBackup=\ntrue\n\n        \nandroid:label=\n@string/app_name\n\n        \nandroid:theme=\n@style/AppTheme\n\n        \nandroid:supportsRtl=\ntrue\n\n        \nandroid:name=\n.MyApplication\n\n\n  \nmeta-data\n \nandroid:name=\nio.branch.sdk.TestMode\n \nandroid:value=\nfalse\n \n/\n \n!-- Set to true to use Branch_Test_Key --\n\n  \nmeta-data\n \nandroid:name=\nio.branch.sdk.BranchKey\n \nandroid:value=\nkey_live_my_live_key\n \n/\n\n  \nmeta-data\n \nandroid:name=\nio.branch.sdk.BranchKey.test\n \nandroid:value=\nkey_test_my_test_key\n \n/\n\n\n  \nreceiver\n \nandroid:name=\nio.branch.referral.InstallListener\n \nandroid:exported=\ntrue\n\n    \nintent-filter\n\n       \naction\n \nandroid:name=\ncom.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER\n \n/\n\n    \n/intent-filter\n\n  \n/receiver\n\n\n/application\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure your Branch links as Android App Links\n\n\nThis guide presumes that you've already configured Branch for Android App Links in the past.

Therefore, Branch cannot open up the existing, pre-installed messages app. Branch can only link to the messages app in the iMessage App Store, even when it's already installed.\n\n\nBecause of this, you should primarily use Branch for tracking installs and deep linking through install. Don't expect a high quality user experience if the app is already installed.\n\n\nMarket your messages app separately from your main app\n\n\nBecause there's no good way to intelligently route to the main App Store, iMessages App Store and existing app depending on the context, we recommend you market your messages app with different links from your main App Store app. So, message to a user you're going to link them to your messages app differently than when you're linking to the App Store app.\n\n\nConfiguring redirects\n\n\nIntroductory concept on messages redirects\n\n\nIf you've read the above, you know that the iMessage App Store is a completely different store than the main App Store.

            "text": "Overview\n\n\nWith a push of a button you can send your Branch data to your Adobe Analytics dashboard, helping you understand the power of Branch as an acquisition pathway.\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\n\nOnce the Branch SDK is integrated into an app, Branch can detect which links are leading to installs, re-opens, and users' actions. Enabling this integration and providing your Adobe Analytics Information will result in Branch automatically forwarding referred events to Adobe Analytics through a server to server integration.\n\n\nWhat events does Branch send?\n\n\nBranch will send \nreferred\n \ninstalls\n and \nopens\n, as well as any \ncustom events\n you track with Branch. Non-referred events, clicks, web session starts, and pageviews will be excluded. Branch also sends all the analytics tags that are attached to the link that drove the referred event. This will allow you to analyze which campaigns, channels, etc. are helping you acquire and engage users.\n\n\nWhat does it look like?\n\n\nBranch events will appear on the Adobe Analytics dashboard through \nReports \n Custom Conversion \n Branch eVar\n. Note, this will automatically appear once the Branch Data Connector is enabled through the Adobe Analytics dashboard.\n\n\nYou'll have the flexibility to analyze data as needed in the Adobe Analytics platform, as the data Branch sends maps in Adobe Analytics to a top level eVar. This eVar contains campaign, channel, target, event name, and action property, which are your analytics tags.\n\n\n\n\nBranch events are similar to Adobe Analytics events in that they can be used to build custom reports and are tracked on the various pages and dashboards. However, unlike normal events, Branch events contain valuable information about how users ended up in your app in the first place.\n\n\nSetup\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n\n\nThis guide requires you to have integrated the Branch SDK in your mobile apps.\n\n\nYou also need to be a Adobe Analytics customer and have the Adobe Analytics SDK integrated.\n\n\n\n\nActivate the Branch Data Connector\n\n\nIn your Adobe Analytics dashboard, under the \nAdmin\n tab, find \nData Connectors\n.\n\n\n\n\nClick \n+Add New\n, search for \"Branch,\" and click \nActivate\n.\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the Branch Data Connector\n\n\nIntegration Settings\n\n\nThese are automatically configured when you activate the Data Connector.\n\n\nVariable Mappings\n\n\nMap your Branch events to your chosen eVar. In the example below, it will be mapped to \nCustom eVar 1\n, renamed to the SiteCatalyst metric \nBranch\n.\n\n\n\n\nData Settings\n\n\nBranch has provided a default classification rule set for the Branch data that will be ingested. This maps Branch analytics data to Adobe classifications as follows. You can change this classification rule set if you would like to, but editing is not required. We also include Branch tags so you can create a new rule that further segments your analytics data for advanced visibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdobe Classification\n\n\nBranch Analytics Tag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\nChannel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampaign\n\n\nCampaign\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nFeature\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nBranch Event Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Property\n\n\nBranch Tags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview Summary\n\n\nFinally, review the integration, scroll to the bottom of the screen and click \nActivate Now\n to enable the integration.\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the Branch Dashboard\n\n\nRetrieve your Adobe Analytics Information\n\n\nBefore navigating to Branch, in your Adobe Analytics dashboard, navigate to the Mobile Marketing UI and find your app.\n\n\nUnder Manage App Setting -\n SDK Analytics Options, find the following data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch field\n\n\nAdobe field value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtocol\n\n\nUse HTTPS Check Box (if checked, select HTTPS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytics Server Domain\n\n\nTracking Server\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmniture iOS/Android Server Key\n\n\nReport Suite ID for that app\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimestamp\n\n\nOffline Tracking\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor \nAnalytics Server Domain\n, please do not include \nhttp\n or \nhttps\n. If your value for this is \nhttp://test.com\n, simply put in \ntest.com\n. This means no extra slashes, and no protocol.\n\n\nEnter Adobe Analytics Information\n\n\n\n\nOn the Branch Dashboard (dashboard.branch.io), navigate to the \nIntegrations page\n.\n\n\nLocate Adobe Analytics and choose \nEnable\n.\n\n\nIf you have not yet entered billing information, please do so now.\n\n\nEnter your Adobe Analytics information and hit \nSave\n.\n\n\n\n\nPass Adobe IDs\n\n\nWhen you're ready to send data through Branch, you'll need to make sure you pass through all the IDs that you have configured on Adobe through the Branch SDKs. In order to do so, figure out which ID you use for user tracking in the Adobe SDK by asking your Adobe Consultant, and pass this value through \nsetRequestMetadataKey\n on the Branch SDKs.\n\n\nThere are three possible identities you can track via this integration. Please verify which IDs you use, and send that. For example, if your Adobe integration uses Marketing Cloud Visitor ID, retrieve it from the Adobe SDK, and pass in a key value pair, with the key being \n$marketing_cloud_visitor_id\n. The value would be the value retrieved through the Adobe SDK. \n\n\nHere are some sample snippet showing this. \nNOTE\n you must set the correct key before calling \ninitSession\n.\n\n\n\n\nMarketing Cloud Visitor ID - \n$marketing_cloud_visitor_id\n \nsent to Adobe as \nmid\n\n\n\n\nObjective-C\n\n\nInside \ndidFinishLaunchingWithOptions\n\n\nBranch\n \n*\nbranch\n \n=\n \n[\nBranch\n \ngetInstance\n];\n\n\n[\nbranch\n \nsetRequestMetadataKey\n:\n@\n$marketing_cloud_visitor_id\n \nvalue\n:[\nADBMobile\n \nvisitorMarketingCloudID\n]];\n\n\n\n\n\nSwift\n\n\nInside \ndidFinishLaunchingWithOptions\n\n\nif\n \nlet\n \nbranch\n \n=\n \nBranch\n.\ngetInstance\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nbranch\n.\nsetRequestMetadataKey\n(\n$marketing_cloud_visitor_id\n,\n \nvalue\n:\nADBMobile\n.\nvisitorMarketingCloudID\n());\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\nBefore you initialize in your Application#onCreate or Deep Link Activity's #onCreate.\n\n\nBranch\n \nbranch\n \n=\n \nBranch\n.\ngetInstance\n();\n\n\nbranch\n.\nsetRequestMetadata\n(\n$marketing_cloud_visitor_id\n,\n \nVisitor\n.\ngetMarketingCloudId\n());\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nBranch\n.\ninitSession\n(...);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytics Custom Visitor ID - \n$analytics_visitor_id\n \nsent to Adobe as \nvid\n\n\n\n\nThis is a custom user ID that can be set using the Adobe SDk and then passed to Branch.\n\n\nObjective-C\n\n\nInside \ndidFinishLaunchingWithOptions\n\n\n//Setting the Identifier with Adobe\n\n\n[\nADBMobile\n \nsetUserIdentifier\n:\n@\nWhipple\n];\n\n\n\n//Passing the Identifier to Branch\n\n\nBranch\n \n*\nbranch\n \n=\n \n[\nBranch\n \ngetInstance\n];\n\n\n[\nbranch\n \nsetRequestMetadataKey\n:\n@\n$analytics_visitor_id\n \nvalue\n:[\nADBMobile\n \nuserIdentifier\n]]\n\n\n\n\n\nSwift\n\n\nInside \ndidFinishLaunchingWithOptions\n\n\n//Setting the Identifier with Adobe\n\n\nADBMobile\n.\nsetUserIdentifier\n(\nWhipple\n)\n\n\n\n//Passing the Identifier to Branch\n\n\nif\n \nlet\n \nbranch\n \n=\n \nBranch\n.\ngetInstance\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nbranch\n.\nsetRequestMetadataKey\n(\n$analytics_visitor_id\n,\n \nvalue\n:\nADBMobile\n.\nuserIdentifier\n())\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\nBefore you initialize in your Application#onCreate or Deep Link Activity's #onCreate.\n\n\n//Setting the Identifier with Adobe\n\n\nConfig\n.\nsetUserIdentifier\n(\nWhipple\n);\n\n\n\n//Passing the Identifier to Branch\n\n\nBranch\n \nbranch\n \n=\n \nBranch\n.\ngetInstance\n();\n\n\nBranch\n.\ngetInstance\n().\nsetRequestMetadata\n(\n$analytics_visitor_id\n,\n \nConfig\n.\ngetUserIdentifier\n());\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nBranch\n.\ninitSession\n(...);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalytics Visitor ID - \n$adobe_visitor_id\n \nsent to Adobe as \naid\n\n\n\n\nObjective-C\n\n\nInside \ndidFinishLaunchingWithOptions\n\n\nBranch\n \n*\nbranch\n \n=\n \n[\nBranch\n \ngetInstance\n];\n\n\n[\nbranch\n \nsetRequestMetadataKey\n:\n@\n$adobe_visitor_id\n \nvalue\n:[\nADBMobile\n \ntrackingIdentifier\n]];\n\n\n\n\n\nSwift\n\n\nInside \ndidFinishLaunchingWithOptions\n\n\nif\n \nlet\n \nbranch\n \n=\n \nBranch\n.\ngetInstance\n()\n \n{\n\n    \nbranch\n.\nsetRequestMetadataKey\n(\n$adobe_visitor_id\n,\n \nvalue\n:\nADBMobile\n.\ntrackingIdentifier\n()\n \nas\n \nNSObject\n!);\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\nBefore you initialize in your Application#onCreate or Deep Link Activity's #onCreate.\n\n\nBranch\n \nbranch\n \n=\n \nBranch\n.\ngetInstance\n();\n\n\nbranch\n.\nsetRequestMetadata\n(\n$adobe_visitor_id\n,\n \nAnalytics\n.\ngetTrackingIdentifier\n());\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\nBranch\n.\ninitSession\n(...);\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced\n\n\nWhat Branch Sends to Adobe Analytics\n\n\nBranch sends the following values from Branch link data in the Adobe Context Data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdobe Classification\n\n\nBranch Analytics Tag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\n\n\nChannel\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampaign\n\n\nCampaign\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium\n\n\nFeature\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction\n\n\nBranch Event Name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Property\n\n\nBranch Tags\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you create a Quick Link and specify analytics, those analytics will appear in the Adobe Analytics reporting suite.\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nThere are common strategies to take while trouble shooting.\n\n\nData isn't appearing after simulating an event\n\n\nWith Adobe Analytics' dashboard, it may take up to ~2 hours for data to appear. We'd recommend you simulate 10-15 events in one testing session, and validate that they show up two hours later, so that feedback is transparent and obvious.\n\n\nAnother thing to do is make sure a valid adobe_visitor_id is being passed up through the Branch SDK. Call \nsetDebug\n and inspect the requests to \nv1/open\n. The key you want to find in this request payload is either \n$adobe_visitor_id\n, \n$marketing_cloud_visitor_id\n, or \n$analytics_visitor_id\n.\n\n\nWhat is Context Data and where does Branch provide it to Adobe?\n\n\nWhen sending server to server calls to Adobe, Context Data is the part in between \nc.\n and \n.c\n in the server call. This call cannot be seen via the client (for example, it is not available via Charles Proxy). To see the detailed Branch server calls, please reach out to your Branch Account Manager.

Android ID (the hardware ID) alone is not enough.\n\n\n\n\nUpgrade to the latest SDKs [if necessary]\n\n\nPlease ensure you're using the Branch iOS SDK 0.12.2 or greater, and Android SDK v1.12.1 or greater.

On iOS, Branch will send the IDFA if present, or the identifierForVendor (IDFV) if present, otherwise it will omit Distinct ID. On Android Branch will send the Google Advertising ID if present, or the Android ID (hardware ID) if present, otherwise it will omit Distinct ID.\n\n\nOn iOS, the Mixpanel SDK by default will use the IDFA if present, otherwise it will use the identifierForVendor (IDFV) (also known as the vendor ID or identifierForVendor). In rare cases where the identifierForVendor (IDFV) is not available, it will generate a random UUID. In order for IDFA to be available, please be sure you have included AdSupport.framework.\n\n\nOn Android, the Mixpanel SDK by default does not use the Google Advertising ID or the Android ID (hardware ID). Instead, it generates a random UUID. This means that on Android, if you do not pass Branch the Mixpanel Distinct ID, we cannot properly associate Branch-generated events with users as identified by Mixpanel.\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nNuances with Multiple Devices and Mixpanel Identities/Aliases\n\n\nIf you at any point change the Mixpanel distinct id for a user as she\u2019s using your app, you should invoke the same one line of code as above. This way, future calls from Branch to Mixpanel use the updated distinct id.\n\n\nAdditionally, there is one scenario in which the event will be logged to Mixpanel but not associated with the correct user. This is due to limitations with identities on Mixpanel\u2019s end.\n\n\nHere is an example scenario:\n\n\nThe User has an iPhone and an iPad\n\n\niPhone has IDFA 1234XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX -- 1234 for short\n\n\niPad has IDFA 5678XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX -- 5678 for short\n\n\nThe User opens the app organically (not from a Branch link), and is automatically assigned the distinctId 1234 (this is the IDFA). Then the user finishes signing up, and alias() is called with value \"User A\", linking 1234 \n \"User A\". All is well so far.\n\n\nThe User then gets placed into a drip email campaign, targeted for re-engagement. She's checking her email on her iPad and clicks on a Branch link to the app. The app is opened. We send Mixpanel a referred event with an automatically assigned distinctId 5678 (this is the IDFA). Then the user logs in, and identify() is called with value \"User A\". Identify() is called because we want the user to match across both devices with the same identity = User A. If we called alias() in this second case, then there would be two distinctIds (and in Mixpanel\u2019s logic, two different people) - one with distinctId 1234 and another with distinctId 5678. In order to merge them, we have to identify() the user on the second device. An unfortunate side effect of this logic is that actions before identify() are not associated with the same user, as there are briefly two distinctIds..\n\n\nThe referred event associated with 5678 is not associated with 1234 / \"User A\".\n\n\nIn order for any additional events on this device to be associated with \"User A\", the app should invoke the one line of code as recommended in the section \nPass Mixpanel Distinct ID\n. Example:\n\n\n[[\nBranch\n \ngetInstance\n]\n \nsetRequestMetadataKey\n:\n@\n$mixpanel_distinct_id\n \nvalue\n:\n@\nUser A\n];\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there are ever workarounds for this, we will update this guide and notify our partners accordingly. \nHere is more information\n on how Mixpanel manages identities.",

In rare cases where the identifierForVendor (IDFV) is not available, it will generate a random UUID. In order for IDFA to be available, please be sure you have included AdSupport.framework.  On Android, the Mixpanel SDK by default does not use the Google Advertising ID or the Android ID (hardware ID). Instead, it generates a random UUID.

This way, future calls from Branch to Mixpanel use the updated distinct id.  Additionally, there is one scenario in which the event will be logged to Mixpanel but not associated with the correct user. This is due to limitations with identities on Mixpanel\u2019s end.  Here is an example scenario:  The User has an iPhone and an iPad  iPhone has IDFA 1234XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX -- 1234 for short  iPad has IDFA 5678XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX -- 5678 for short  The User opens the app organically (not from a Branch link), and is automatically assigned the distinctId 1234 (this is the IDFA). Then the user finishes signing up, and alias() is called with value \"User A\", linking 1234   \"User A\". All is well so far.  The User then gets placed into a drip email campaign, targeted for re-engagement. She's checking her email on her iPad and clicks on a Branch link to the app. The app is opened. We send Mixpanel a referred event with an automatically assigned distinctId 5678 (this is the IDFA). Then the user logs in, and identify() is called with value \"User A\". Identify() is called because we want the user to match across both devices with the same identity = User A. If we called alias() in this second case, then there would be two distinctIds (and in Mixpanel\u2019s logic, two different people) - one with distinctId 1234 and another with distinctId 5678. In order to merge them, we have to identify() the user on the second device. An unfortunate side effect of this logic is that actions before identify() are not associated with the same user, as there are briefly two distinctIds..  The referred event associated with 5678 is not associated with 1234 / \"User A\".  In order for any additional events on this device to be associated with \"User A\", the app should invoke the one line of code as recommended in the section  Pass Mixpanel Distinct ID . Example:  [[ Branch   getInstance ]   setRequestMetadataKey : @ $mixpanel_distinct_id   value : @ User A ];   If there are ever workarounds for this, we will update this guide and notify our partners accordingly.

You also need to be a Tune customer and have the Tune SDK (\niOS\n, \nAndroid\n) installed in your app.\n\n\n\n\nGet credentials from your Tune dashboard\n\n\nTo set up the integration you will need your \nTune Advertiser ID\n (an account-level identifier), your platform-specific Tune \nSite IDs\n (also known as App IDs) and a Tune \nPublisher ID\n for Branch.\n\n\nYou can find your \nAdvertiser ID\n by navigating to \"Accounts \n Advertiser Account\" in the left hand sidebar and finding the Advertiser ID in the Account Details.\n\n\n\n\nYou can find your \nSite ID\n by navigating to \"Mobile Apps\" in the left hand sidebar and getting the relevant Site ID from the table.\n\n\n\n\nTo retrieve Branch's \nPublisher ID\n from Tune it is first necessary to set Branch up as an \nIntegrated Partner\n and find the Publisher ID:\n\n\n\n\nLog in to Tune and go to Attribution Analytics\n\n\nIn the navigation bar on the left side of the portal, under the Partners section, click: Integrations\n\n\nOn the Integrated Partners page (on the right side), search for Branch\n\n\nSelect Branch and, in the far-right column, click: Enable\n\n\nClick on the Branch logo, then click on the \"Attribution Settings\" tab and copy the Partner ID (also known as the Branch Publisher ID)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable the Tune card in your Branch dashboard\n\n\n\n\nOn the Branch Dashboard (\nhttps://dashboard.branch.io\n) navigate to the \nIntegrations page\n.\n\n\nLocate Tune and choose \nEnable\n.\n\n\nIf you have not yet entered billing information, please do so now.\n\n\nEnter your Branch Partner ID, the Tune Advertiser ID and your platform-specific Tune Site IDs.\n\n\nHit \nSave\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced\n\n\nWhat Branch sends to Tune\n\n\nBranch will send any parameters that you append to a link on to Tune (see \nbelow for adding advanced attribution parameters\n). By default, if you don't append any additional parameters to your link, Branch will pass Branch Analytics tags on to Tune with the below mapping.\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\nIf you enabled the Tune integration before August 10th 2016, your analytics tags will map to sub_publisher and sub_placement. To get the updated mappings please disable and re-enable the Tune card in your dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch Analytics Tag\n\n\nTune Data Placeholder Tag\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCampaign\n\n\nmy_campaign\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChannel\n\n\nmy_placement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\n\n\nmy_keyword\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch Click ID\n\n\ntracking_id\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the methods Branch uses to let TUNE know an install came from Branch?\n\n\nWe rely on 3 methods to match attributions into TUNE\u2019s dashboard.\n\n\n\n\nThe first is snapshotting, which is the most basic. This is when we send a click event to Tune with IP address and User Agent and Tune completes the attribution.\n\n\nThe next method is passing the Google Advertising Id or IDFA on iOS. This occurs when a Universal or App link drove open the app session via Branch (meaning a click never touched the browser). In this case, we can attribute Branch correctly in TUNE\u2019s dashboard 100% of the time, because TUNE receives the IDFA / GAID from Branch while also keeping reference to it through their own SDK.\n\n\nThe third method is passing along Branch\u2019s click ID through the install referrer on Android, and the URI scheme on iOS. The TUNE SDK consumes the click ID through these mechanisms and then Branch sends that same click id back to TUNE. This also results in a 100% match.\n\n\n\n\nBy following all the steps listed in this guide, you\u2019ll automatically have all 3 available.\n\n\nAdvanced network segmentation with Tune\n\n\nIf you are interested in advanced network attribution segmentation in Tune, you can use the same attribution parameters you'd append to a Tune Measurement URL with your Branch link.\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\nIf you enabled the Tune integration before August 10th 2016, you will need to disable and re-enable the Tune card in your dashboard before carrying out the instructions below. Please note this will change your default mapping of Branch analytics tags from the sub_publisher and sub_placement values into the my_partner values as noted above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart with an existing Branch link, for example, a \nQuick Link\n.\n\n\nAppend \n?\n to the end of your link to start the query params string. For example: \nhttps://mylinks.app.link/8AHjQx0fyv\n?\n\n\nNext, \ncreate a measurement URL\n in Tune's Attribution Analytics Dashboard with the parameters you'd like to capture.\n\n\nSelect the \"Click\" URL (as opposed to the Impression URL)\n\n\nAfter creating the measurement URL, copy everything after \naction=click\n and append the parameters to the end of your Branch link.\n\n\nYou should remove \nsite_id={value}\n from the parameters, as Branch will automatically fill that in for your app depending on platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour new URL will now pass useful parameters to Tune.\n\n\nFor example, here's a finalized link for Tapjoy:\n\n\nhttps://mylinks.app.link/8AHjQx0fyv?\n    \npublisher_id\n=\n334667\n\n    \nsub_campaign\n=\nTapjoyBranchCampaign\n\n    \nmy_publisher\n=\nTapjoy\n\n    \nsub1\n=\ncustomtapjoyparameter\n\n    \nandroid_id\n=\nTAPJOY_RESTORED_RAW_ADVERTISING_ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\nBranch automatically uses the my_* parameters for its link data. If there is a conflict between the custom parameters you append to your Branch link and the default parameters Branch automatically sends to Tune, the custom parameters will override the default data.\n\n\n\n\nSending Google ValueTrack Parameters to Tune\n\n\nFor AdWords App Install Campaigns, you can append ValueTrack parameters to your Branch link by following the same instructions highlighted above.\n\n\nWhen you create a Measurement URL in the Tune dashboard, the following URL parameters will automatically be generated and should be appended to the end of your Branch link (line breaks added for legibility):\n\n\nhttps://mylinks.app.link/8AHjQx0fyv?\n    \nsub_publisher\n={\nnetwork\n}\n\n    \nsub_placement\n={\nplacement\n}\n\n    \nsub_ad\n={\ncreative\n}\n\n    \nsub_campaign\n={\ncampaignid\n}\n\n    \nattr_core\n=\n1\n\n    \nsub_keyword\n={\nkeyword\n}\n\n    \ngdevice\n={\ndevice\n}\n\n    \ngmodel\n={\ndevicemodel\n}\n\n    \nis_mobile\n={\nifmobile:\n[\nvalue\n]}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacros\n\n\nWith the macros \n{}\n, Google will insert the relevant values for each parameter, values which will then be passed to Tune's Attribution Analytics.\n\n\n\n\nFor a full list of supported value parameters for AdWords, check out Tune's \nGoogle AdWords Integration\n documentation.\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nHow can I test this integration?\n\n\n\n\nEnable the integration\n\n\nCreate a Branch link\n\n\nClick the Branch link so the app opens or you are taken to the app store. If you're taken to the app store, download and open the app.\n\n\nLog in to your Tune dashboard, and click \"Logs\" on the left hand side bar.\n\n\nCheck the \"Click\" logs for a click attributed to Branch (or the network if you are using measurement URL parameters)\n\n\nCheck the \"Installs\" or \"Opens\" logs for a correctly attributed install.\n\n\nAfter 10-15 minutes, you should see an install or open appear in your Attribution Dashboard.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that to produce installs, you must delete the app and reset your advertising identifier, then click a Branch link and install the app.\n\n\nBranch data not appearing in Tune\n\n\nEnsure Branch is an enabled provider under your \nPartners\n in your TUNE dashboard. This should happen automatically, but to verify, click into the \nIntegrated Partners\n section on your TUNE dashboard. From there, enter in Branch inside the search box, and click enable.\n\n\nIn this section, click on \nAttribution Settings\n. You'll see a section called \nAttribution Windows\n. Ensure \nFingerprint Attribution Window\n is set to 3 hours or more. If you have this disabled, events will not be attributed to Branch.\n\n\nInstall discrepancies\n\n\nCapture the GAID and IDFA device identifiers\n\n\nEnsure that you are capturing both the Google Advertising Identifier (GAID) on Android, and the IDFA on iOS.\n\n\nAdd Google Play Install Referrer (Android)\n\n\nWhen you integrate the Tune SDK, ensure you add the install referrer snippet provided Tune \nhere\n.\n\n\nIssues with Facebook data discrepancies.\n\n\nIf you are finding data discrepancies between Branch, Tune and Facebook - please ensure you have followed the Facebook Ads setup and troubleshooting steps \nhere\n.\n\n\nIf you're using the Tune integration and Branch links in Facebook ads, Branch must initialize and complete before the Tune SDK.

This is when we send a click event to Tune with IP address and User Agent and Tune completes the attribution.  The next method is passing the Google Advertising Id or IDFA on iOS. This occurs when a Universal or App link drove open the app session via Branch (meaning a click never touched the browser). In this case, we can attribute Branch correctly in TUNE\u2019s dashboard 100% of the time, because TUNE receives the IDFA / GAID from Branch while also keeping reference to it through their own SDK.  The third method is passing along Branch\u2019s click ID through the install referrer on Android, and the URI scheme on iOS. The TUNE SDK consumes the click ID through these mechanisms and then Branch sends that same click id back to TUNE. This also results in a 100% match.   By following all the steps listed in this guide, you\u2019ll automatically have all 3 available.",

Caution  If you enabled the Tune integration before August 10th 2016, you will need to disable and re-enable the Tune card in your dashboard before carrying out the instructions below. Please note this will change your default mapping of Branch analytics tags from the sub_publisher and sub_placement values into the my_partner values as noted above.    Start with an existing Branch link, for example, a  Quick Link .  Append  ?  to the end of your link to start the query params string. For example:  https://mylinks.app.link/8AHjQx0fyv ?  Next,  create a measurement URL  in Tune's Attribution Analytics Dashboard with the parameters you'd like to capture.  Select the \"Click\" URL (as opposed to the Impression URL)  After creating the measurement URL, copy everything after  action=click  and append the parameters to the end of your Branch link.  You should remove  site_id={value}  from the parameters, as Branch will automatically fill that in for your app depending on platform.      Your new URL will now pass useful parameters to Tune.  For example, here's a finalized link for Tapjoy:  https://mylinks.app.link/8AHjQx0fyv?\n     publisher_id = 334667 \n     sub_campaign = TapjoyBranchCampaign \n     my_publisher = Tapjoy \n     sub1 = customtapjoyparameter \n     android_id = TAPJOY_RESTORED_RAW_ADVERTISING_ID   Caution  Branch automatically uses the my_* parameters for its link data.

At this time webhooks can only be sent every time an event occurs. The option to send webhooks \nthe first time\n an event occurs is roadmapped for release in Q1 2018.\n\n\n\n\nBasic filtering\n\n\nIn the \nAdvanced\n section of the page you can create a filter. Only events that \npass the filter criteria\n will be sent. \n\n\nYou'll notice a default filter that checks to see whether the event is \nnot\n triggered by a known crawler/robot. To do this, we check if the Operating System does not equal \"robots.\" With that filter applied, only events without OS equal to robots (i.e. iOS and Android) will trigger a webhook.\n\n\nThe most popular filter options are available in a dropdown. This should help you get up and running quickly, while also providing an example structure for more \nadvanced filtering\n if you need it.\n\n\nTo create a filter:\n\n\n\n\nClick the \nAdd Filter\n button\n\n\nSelect the metadata you'd like to filter on. For example, if you only want \niOS\n installs, select \"Operating System\" from the dropdown. You'll see the text field to the right populate with the correct key. When doing advanced filtering later you will select \"Custom\" and manually set this key.\n\n\nSelect \"equals\" or \"does not equal\" from next dropdown.\n\n\nFinally, set the \nvalue\n of the key that you'd like to filter in or out. For example, if you want iOS installs, you'll have set up \"equals\" and \"IOS\" in the dropdowns. In this example, the robots filter is redundant, so let's remove it using the minus button.\n\n\n\n\nThis should be your final view before saving:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Filtering installs by attributed link campaign\n\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re interested in receiving a webhook for every \ninstall\n event that is referred from a Branch link where you set the \nCampaign\n field to \nApp Install Campaign\n. You would configure a filter to fire a webhook only when \nCampaign\n is equal to \n\"App Install Campaign\"\n. You would select \nCampaign\n from the dropdown, the key would be be autofilled and would equal \nlast_attributed_touch_data.~campaign\n. Finally, you'd set the value equal to \nApp Install Campaign\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Filtering clicks by link channel\n\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re interested in receiving a webhook for every \nclick\n event that is referred from a Branch link where you set the \nChannel\n field to \nAppLovin\n. You would configure a filter to fire a webhook only when \nChannel\n is equal to \nAppLovin\n. You would select \nChannel\n from the dropdown, the key would be be autofilled and would equal \nlast_attributed_touch_data.~channel\n. Finally, you'd set the value equal to \nAppLovin\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee the \nAdvanced Filtering\n page to read more about customizing when events are sent.\n\n\nTesting\n\n\nTo test whether your webhook is configured correctly, you can use \nrequestb.in\n. RequestBin gives you a URL that accepts events for 24 hours and allows you to see exactly what Branch is sending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nrequestb.in\n and click \n+ Create a RequestBin\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy the \nBin URL\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaste this into the URL field of your Branch webhook's configuration screen:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow whenever your webhook is triggered, you will see a full report on RequestBin:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\nPlease archive your Requestbin webhook when you have finished testing. Requestbins only last for 24 hours and return errors once they expire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Format\n\n\nOne of the major advantages of People-Based Attribution's data format is that metadata is consistently located across all events. We call this schema the \nEvent Ontology Data Schema\n. This consistent schema makes it easy to replicate Branch dashboards in your internal warehouse and compare large sets of data for different events.\n\n\nSetting up Advanced Filters or Freemarker macros requires an understanding of the Event Ontology data format. Before diving into the schema, you should understand some high level concepts about event metadata structure:\n\n\n\n\nEach event has top level fields, such as \"name\" and \"id\" that are not nested\n\n\nLink data is generally nested in \"Last Attributed Touch Data\"\n\n\nUser data (including device and OS data) is nested in \"User Data\"\n\n\nProduct or content level data is nested in \"Content Items\"\n\n\nTransaction and generic content data is nested in \"Event Data\"\n\n\nJourneys or Deepviews view data (e.g. Journey banners loads, not clicks) is \"Last CTA View Data\"\n\n\nClient-specified custom data (e.g. internal fields your company requires on specific events) is nested in \"Custom Data\"\n\n\n\n\nYou can find an \noverview of critical fields\n in that documentation, as well as an \nexhaustive list of fields\n.\n\n\nSample webhook POST body syntax\n\n\nThe POST body for all webhooks follows the same structure:\n\n\nPOST\n\n\nUser\n-\nagent\n:\n \nBranch\n \nMetrics\n \nAPI\n\n\nContent\n-\nType\n:\n \napplication\n/\njson\n\n\n{\n\n    \nname\n:\n \nevent name e.g. open\n,\n\n    \nuser_data\n:\n \n{},\n\n    \nlast_cta_view_data\n:\n \n{},\n\n    \nlast_attributed_touch_data\n:\n \n{},\n\n    \ncustom_data\n:\n \n{},\n\n    \nevent_data\n:\n \n{},\n\n    \ncontent_items\n:\n \n{},\n\n    \ntimestamp\n:\n \nexample timestamp (int)\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nIf any of these objects are empty, they will not appear in the POST body.\n\n\nHere's a POST body with example data for an attributed open:\n\n\n// Attributed open\n\n\nPOST\n\n\nUser\n-\nagent\n:\n \nBranch\n \nMetrics\n \nAPI\n\n\nContent\n-\nType\n:\n \napplication\n/\njson\n\n\n\n{\n\n  \nname\n:\n \nopen\n,\n\n  \nuser_data\n:\n \n{\n\n    \nos\n:\n \nIOS\n,\n\n    \nos_version\n:\n \n11.1.2\n,\n\n    \nenvironment\n:\n \nFULL_APP\n,\n\n    \nplatform\n:\n \nIOS_APP\n,\n\n    \nidfa\n:\n \nF520B35A-4165-4426-98F6-64F12F47E9BZ\n,\n\n    \nidfv\n:\n \nC6B869E7-7B0A-4A93-1C3D-960E8859DP5D\n,\n\n    \nlimit_ad_tracking\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n    \nuser_agent\n:\n \nMozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 11_1_2 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/604.3.5 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/15B202\n,\n\n    \nip\n:\n \n50.200.105.218\n,\n\n    \ndeveloper_identity\n:\n \nDB8C86A6-8B7C-4192-BD29-8107A5B788A1\n,\n\n    \ncountry\n:\n \nUS\n,\n\n    \nlanguage\n:\n \nEN\n,\n\n    \nbrand\n:\n \nApple\n\n  \n},\n\n  \nlast_cta_view_data\n:\n \n{\n\n    \n~id\n:\n \n457624031399716729\n,\n\n    \n~campaign\n:\n \n_test\n,\n\n    \n~feature\n:\n \njourneys\n,\n\n    \n+domain\n:\n \nbranchster.app.link\n,\n\n    \n+url\n:\n \nhttps://branchster.app.link/jeMczRn5XH\n,\n\n    \n$deeplink_path\n:\n \nopen/item/1234\n,\n\n    \n~creation_source\n:\n \n5\n,\n\n    \n+referrer\n:\n \nhttps://store.com/products/green-table\n,\n\n    \nfoo\n:\n \nbar\n,\n\n    \n$canonical_url\n:\n \nhttps://store.com/products/green-table\n,\n\n    \nmydata\n:\n \nset_branch_view_data_value\n,\n\n    \n~tags\n:\n \n[\n\n      \ntag1\n,\n\n      \ntag2\n,\n\n      \nbottom_banner_style\n\n    \n]\n\n  \n},\n\n  \nlast_attributed_touch_data\n:\n \n{\n\n    \n~id\n:\n \n467391383381228204\n,\n\n    \n~feature\n:\n \nmarketing\n,\n\n    \n~campaign\n:\n \ndecember_test\n,\n\n    \n~channel\n:\n \nFacebook Organic\n,\n\n    \nproduct_id\n:\n \nXBA8198j\n,\n\n    \nproduct_name\n:\n \nGreen Table AB10\n,\n\n    \n+url\n:\n \nhttps://branchster.app.link/test_linking\n,\n\n    \n$marketing_title\n:\n \nDeep Link Testing\n,\n\n    \n$ios_deepview\n:\n \nbranch_default\n,\n\n    \n+via_features\n:\n \n[\n\n      \nQUICK_LINKS\n\n    \n]\n\n  \n},\n\n  \ncustom_data\n:\n \n{\n\n    \nreinstall\n:\n \nfalse\n,\n\n    \nip\n:\n \n50.200.105.218\n,\n\n    \nreferred\n:\n \nfalse\n\n  \n},\n\n  \ntimestamp\n:\n \n1512681005807\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Filtering\n\n\nIn \nBasic Filtering\n we covered what filters do, and how to set basic filters. Branch supports more advanced filtering which allows customers to set filters based on almost any event metadata.\n\n\nMake sure you've taken a look at the \ndata format\n before you attempt to set advanced filters.\n\n\nTo create a filter:\n\n\n\n\nClick the \nAdd Filter\n button\n\n\nSelect the metadata you'd like to filter on. For advanced filtering, choose \"Custom\"\n\n\nType in the key that you'd like to filter on. To find the key you'd like to filter on, reference our quick introduction to the \nPeople-Based Attribution's data format\n to figure out where your key is likely nested. Another foolproof way to find your key is looking at your data in full before setting up your filter. You can do this by doing a \nCSV export\n, \nAPI export\n or send a single webhook with a POST body, and locate your key in that POST body.\n\n\nUnless your key is part of the top level data (e.g. \ntimestamp\n or \nid\n), it will likely be nested one level deep. Most keys will be of the format \nobject_name.key\n. For example, if you want to filter for a custom key in deep link data called \"product_deeplink_id\", that would take the form \nlast_attributed_touch_data.product_deeplink_id\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Filtering purchases for a specific coupon\n\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re interested in receiving a webhook for every \nPurchase\n event using a specific coupon. When you set up the Purchase event in your app or on your website, you \nadded a specific piece of metadata for \"coupon\"\n. In the \nEvent Ontology Schema\n you saw that \"coupon\" is inside \"event_data\". To configure your filter to fire a webhook only when \ncoupon\n is equal to \nSUMMERDEALS10\n you will:\n\n\n\n\nSelect \"Custom\" from the filter key dropdown\n\n\nMake the key \nevent_data.coupon\n\n\nSelect \"equals\" on the equivalency dropdown\n\n\nEnter a value of \nSUMMERDEALS10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArray filtering not yet available\n\n\nCurrently, webhooks do not support filtering on values inside arrays. Example arrays that cannot be filtered by value are \ntags\n, \n+via_features\n and \ncontent_items\n.\n\n\n\n\nTemplating your Postback URL\n\n\nIf you'd like to template your postback URL, you\u2019ll likely need to create one of our templated Postback URLs along side the aforementioned filters. These work very similarly to filters but use Freemarker syntax.\n\n\nGetting started with templates\n\n\nTo start, we can add a simple template. Let's say we want to add campaign as a query parameter. The correct syntax is \n\n\nhttps://webhook.com?campaign=${(last_attributed_touch_data.~campaign)!}\n\n\nLet's walk through the syntax:\n\n\n\n\nFirst, find the key for the value you want to template in. As with filtering, to find the key, reference our quick introduction to the \nPeople-Based Attribution's data format\n to figure out where your key is likely nested. Another foolproof way to find your key is looking at your data in full before setting up your filter. You can do this by doing a \nCSV export\n, \nAPI export\n or send a single webhook with a POST body, and locate your key in that POST body.\n\n\nThis exercise tells us that Campaign is nested inside \nlast_attributed_touch_data\n and is represented by \nlast_attributed_touch_data.~campaign\n.\n\n\nThe additional syntax around \nlast_attributed_touch_data.~campaign\n is because Branch's templating engine uses Freemarker. In Freemarker, you can print variables by surrounding them with \n${}\n. Finally, we add \n()!\n to the variable because we want to prevent errors in the case that there is no value.\n\n\nThis leaves us with \n${(last_attributed_touch_data.~campaign)!}\n.\n\n\n\n\nHere is some more example Freemarker for common templates:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParent object\n\n\nCommon name\n\n\nFreemarker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Attributed Touch Data\n\n\nFeature\n\n\n${(last_attributed_touch_data.~feature)!}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Attributed Touch Data\n\n\nChannel\n\n\n${(last_attributed_touch_data.~channel)!}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Attributed Touch Data\n\n\nCampaign\n\n\n${(last_attributed_touch_data.~campaign)!}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Attributed Touch Data\n\n\nAd Partner Name\n\n\n${(last_attributed_touch_data.~advertising_partner_name)!}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Data\n\n\nOS\n\n\n${(user_data.os)!}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Data\n\n\nPlatform\n\n\n${(user_data.platform)!}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Data\n\n\nIDFA\n\n\n${(user_data.idfa)!}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Data\n\n\nIDFV\n\n\n${(user_data.idfv)!}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Data\n\n\nAndroid Advertising ID\n\n\n${(user_data.aaid)!}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFreemarker expressions\n\n\nDue to security restrictions, Branch does not support the full list of Freemarker expressions.\n\n\nHere is a list of blocked expressions:\n\n#import\n,\n \n#visit\n,\n \n#include\n,\n \n?eval\n,\n \n#recurse\n,\n \n#setting\n,\n \n#macro\n,\n \n#function\n,\n \n#nested\n,\n \n#return\n,\n \n#list\n\n\n\n\nAuthenticating webhook events\n\n\nTo request authentication headers for your webhooks, please contact \nintegrations@branch.io\n.\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nFAQs\n\n\nWhy is my webhook not firing?\n\n\nCheck to see if you are in \nTest Mode\n with your SDK.

You'll notice a default filter that checks to see whether the event is  not  triggered by a known crawler/robot. To do this, we check if the Operating System does not equal \"robots.\" With that filter applied, only events without OS equal to robots (i.e. iOS and Android) will trigger a webhook.  The most popular filter options are available in a dropdown. This should help you get up and running quickly, while also providing an example structure for more  advanced filtering  if you need it.  To create a filter:   Click the  Add Filter  button  Select the metadata you'd like to filter on. For example, if you only want  iOS  installs, select \"Operating System\" from the dropdown. You'll see the text field to the right populate with the correct key. When doing advanced filtering later you will select \"Custom\" and manually set this key.  Select \"equals\" or \"does not equal\" from next dropdown.  Finally, set the  value  of the key that you'd like to filter in or out. For example, if you want iOS installs, you'll have set up \"equals\" and \"IOS\" in the dropdowns. In this example, the robots filter is redundant, so let's remove it using the minus button.   This should be your final view before saving:    Example: Filtering installs by attributed link campaign  Let\u2019s say you\u2019re interested in receiving a webhook for every  install  event that is referred from a Branch link where you set the  Campaign  field to  App Install Campaign . You would configure a filter to fire a webhook only when  Campaign  is equal to  \"App Install Campaign\" . You would select  Campaign  from the dropdown, the key would be be autofilled and would equal  last_attributed_touch_data.~campaign . Finally, you'd set the value equal to  App Install Campaign .     Example: Filtering clicks by link channel  Let\u2019s say you\u2019re interested in receiving a webhook for every  click  event that is referred from a Branch link where you set the  Channel  field to  AppLovin . You would configure a filter to fire a webhook only when  Channel  is equal to  AppLovin . You would select  Channel  from the dropdown, the key would be be autofilled and would equal  last_attributed_touch_data.~channel . Finally, you'd set the value equal to  AppLovin .

            "text": "In  Basic Filtering  we covered what filters do, and how to set basic filters. Branch supports more advanced filtering which allows customers to set filters based on almost any event metadata.  Make sure you've taken a look at the  data format  before you attempt to set advanced filters.  To create a filter:   Click the  Add Filter  button  Select the metadata you'd like to filter on. For advanced filtering, choose \"Custom\"  Type in the key that you'd like to filter on. To find the key you'd like to filter on, reference our quick introduction to the  People-Based Attribution's data format  to figure out where your key is likely nested. Another foolproof way to find your key is looking at your data in full before setting up your filter. You can do this by doing a  CSV export ,  API export  or send a single webhook with a POST body, and locate your key in that POST body.  Unless your key is part of the top level data (e.g.  timestamp  or  id ), it will likely be nested one level deep. Most keys will be of the format  object_name.key . For example, if you want to filter for a custom key in deep link data called \"product_deeplink_id\", that would take the form  last_attributed_touch_data.product_deeplink_id .    Example: Filtering purchases for a specific coupon  Let\u2019s say you\u2019re interested in receiving a webhook for every  Purchase  event using a specific coupon. When you set up the Purchase event in your app or on your website, you  added a specific piece of metadata for \"coupon\" . In the  Event Ontology Schema  you saw that \"coupon\" is inside \"event_data\". To configure your filter to fire a webhook only when  coupon  is equal to  SUMMERDEALS10  you will:   Select \"Custom\" from the filter key dropdown  Make the key  event_data.coupon  Select \"equals\" on the equivalency dropdown  Enter a value of  SUMMERDEALS10      Array filtering not yet available  Currently, webhooks do not support filtering on values inside arrays.

The correct syntax is   https://webhook.com?campaign=${(last_attributed_touch_data.~campaign)!}  Let's walk through the syntax:   First, find the key for the value you want to template in. As with filtering, to find the key, reference our quick introduction to the  People-Based Attribution's data format  to figure out where your key is likely nested. Another foolproof way to find your key is looking at your data in full before setting up your filter. You can do this by doing a  CSV export ,  API export  or send a single webhook with a POST body, and locate your key in that POST body.  This exercise tells us that Campaign is nested inside  last_attributed_touch_data  and is represented by  last_attributed_touch_data.~campaign .  The additional syntax around  last_attributed_touch_data.~campaign  is because Branch's templating engine uses Freemarker. In Freemarker, you can print variables by surrounding them with  ${} . Finally, we add  ()!  to the variable because we want to prevent errors in the case that there is no value.  This leaves us with  ${(last_attributed_touch_data.~campaign)!} .   Here is some more example Freemarker for common templates:     Parent object  Common name  Freemarker      Last Attributed Touch Data  Feature  ${(last_attributed_touch_data.~feature)!}    Last Attributed Touch Data  Channel  ${(last_attributed_touch_data.~channel)!}    Last Attributed Touch Data  Campaign  ${(last_attributed_touch_data.~campaign)!}    Last Attributed Touch Data  Ad Partner Name  ${(last_attributed_touch_data.~advertising_partner_name)!}    User Data  OS  ${(user_data.os)!}    User Data  Platform  ${(user_data.platform)!}    User Data  IDFA  ${(user_data.idfa)!}    User Data  IDFV  ${(user_data.idfv)!}    User Data  Android Advertising ID  ${(user_data.aaid)!}",

            "text": "Overview\n\n\nThere are several mechanisms Branch uses to pass data through to the app and attribute app sessions back to the source. We always use the method with the highest match confidence rate. When we are 100% confident, the deep link data will contain the variable \n+match_guaranteed=true\n.\n\n\nMethods with 100% match accuracy\n\n\nDirect deeplinking\n\n\nIf the app is currently installed on the phone, and you've configured your Branch links with your app's URI scheme (\nmyapp://\n) or to use Universal or App Links, we will open the app immediately and pass a click identifier through to our native library. This click identifier is then sent to the Branch servers to retrieve the dictionary of data associated with the link.\n\n\nFor example, we'd call \nmyapp://open?link_click_id=123456\n to open the app immediately. The Branch native library parses out \nlink_click_id: 123456\n and passes it back to the Branch API to retrieve the data dictionary associated with that link click.\n\n\nDevice ID token matching across the Branch Network\n\n\nWhen a user clicks a Branch link for your app, and we've seen that user click a link for \nanother\n app on our partner network, we've already matched them up to a corresponding device identifier. This means that when they install the app, we know with 100% certainty that they just came from that link click.\n\n\nThe fact that we have such a global network of apps with hundreds of millions of users clicking links, means that when you join the platform, you can benefit from the crowd-sourced accuracy gained through all our apps contributing the browser-app profiles. Read more about how important this is on \nour blog\n.\n\n\nLeveraging other match techniques\n\n\nWe've built out custom deep linking mechanisms that are specific to each platform to ensure that deep linking is accurate. Here are some of those techniques we use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatch Method\n\n\nImplementation Details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook deferred deep linking API\n\n\nWe've built a custom integration with Facebook where if a user originates from an app invite or advertisement, we connect with Facebook's API to know with 100% certainty if the install originated from this source. You'll need to authenticate with Facebook on the Branch dash if you want to support this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndroid Google Play referrer\n\n\nGoogle Play supports passing a referrer through the install process that we listen for. It's notoriously unreliable and currently unsupported when redirecting from Chrome. However, we'll use it when available. Enabling this method is covered in the \nSDK Integration Guide\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\niOS 9/10 Safari cookie passthrough\n\n\nWe built a custom technique into our iOS SDK that will guarantee 100% accuracy on iOS 9/10 when a user clicks from the Safari browser. This only applies if you include SafariServices.framework in your app. Please see our new recommended \npath to use this feature\n. Note that this method has some risks due to a policy change on iOS on 9/1/16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndroid Chrome Tabs cookie passthrough\n\n\nWe built a custom technique into our Android SDK that will guarantee 100% accuracy when a user originates from the Chrome browser. We're automatically cookie match based on app.link, but you can configure the domain depending on your use case. Please see \nthe guide here\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods without 100% match accuracy\n\n\nBrowser to app snapshot match\n\n\nBranch collects information about devices both when a user is in the browser -- via a click on a Branch link -- and then after they open the app. This information includes \nIP Address\n, \nOS\n, \nOS version\n, \ndevice model\n and other parameters. This is the user's \ndigital snapshot\n and can be obtained in the browser and in the app.\n\n\nWhen no 100% match method is available, we connect the unique snapshot collected in the app to the unique snapshot collected in the browser to determine where user originated.\n\n\n\n\nCustomize the snapshot matching criteria\n\n\nIf you are concerned that users may potentially have the same snapshot, you can choose to have us not match users if two identical snapshots are outstanding. On the Dashboard's \nLink Settings\n page, under advanced options, you should set \nMatch Type\n to \nUnique\n. You can also modify the 7200 second (2 hour) default expiration for all links, or \nconfigure it for individual links\n by using the \n$match_duration\n control parameter.\n\n\n\n\nThis means that if two users with the same snapshot, on the same wifi, were to click a Branch link for your app, we would blacklist those digital snapshots for the expiration duration. Therefore, when either user opens up your app, no match would be made.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Your iOS App for 100% Match\n\n\n100% match is a bit of a misnomer, as it is only 100% match from when a user clicks from the Safari browser. According to our analysis, clicking through Safari happens about 50-75% of the time depending on the use case. For example, clicking from Facebook or Chrome won't trigger a 100% match here. However, it's still beneficial to the matching accuracy, so we recommend employing it.\n\n\nInclude SafariServices.framework\n\n\nFirst off, you'll need to include the \nSafariServices.framework\n into your app to leverage this. Currently, as soon as you add the Framework, Branch will start triggering the Safari-based 100% match technique. To add the framework, simply go to your Xcode project:\n\n\n\n\nSelect the right build target\n\n\nSelect the \nGeneral\n tab\n\n\nScroll down to \nLinked Frameworks and Libraries\n\n\nClick the \n+\n button\n\n\nAdd \nSafariServices.framework\n\n\n\n\nSet the matching domain to app.link\n\n\nBecause our Safari View Controller matching method works based on comparing the cookie Branch set on a click to the cookie set with the View Controller, the domains must be consistent. iOS assumes that you're on the \nbnc.lt\n domain, so if you're using \napp.link\n domain as your default (most apps), you must specify this domain in your PLIST file.\n\n\nPlease set the \nbranch_app_domain\n to \napp.link\n in your PLIST as shown below:\n\n\n\n\nNeed to disable SafariViewController?\n\n\nNote that this mechanism can be \ndisabled\n using the following method, which should be called \nbefore\n \ninitSession\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObjective-C\n\n\n[[\nBranch\n \ngetInstance\n]\n \ndisableCookieBasedMatching\n];\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwift\n\n\nBranch\n.\ngetInstance\n().\ndisableCookieBasedMatching\n()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring Your Android App for 100% Match\n\n\nSimilar to iOS, 100% match is a bit of a misnomer since this method will only work if a user clicks via the Chrome browser. Other browsers such as Facebook and Twitter will not benefit from this method. We haven't pull the stats on usage like we do on iOS, but we'd assume it's similar to Safari (50-75% of clicks).\n\n\nEnable cookie matching\n\n\nAdd \ncompile 'com.android.support:customtabs:23.3.0'\n to the dependencies section of your \nbuild.gradle\n file.\n\n\nUse the legacy bnc.lt domain for cookie matching\n\n\nUnlike on iOS where we assume that your domain is on \nbnc.lt\n, on Android we assume it is the \napp.link\n domain. If you want to override it, you must set the domain you want via a call to Branch like so:\n\n\n// call before calling getAutoInstance in the Application class\n\n\nBranch\n.\nenableCookieBasedMatching\n(\nbnc.lt\n);\n\n\nBranch\n.\ngetAutoInstance\n(\nthis\n);",

If the target in question is an extension, the tool will add the SDK, set the keys into the Info.plist, and patch source (if it's a Messages extension, for example).\n\n\nIncludes Rake for Task Management\n: This gem has a rake for Task Management that is available \nhere\n.\n\n\nFastlane Plugin\n: There is also a Fastlane plugin available \nhere\n, should you prefer to use it instead.\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that you\u2019ve set up your Branch Dashboard using the instructions \nhere\n, and have your Branch Key and Branch link domain handy.\n\n\nAn iOS project with which you\u2019d like to integrate Branch.\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\n\n\n\n\nFrom terminal, cd into your iOS app\u2019s project directory (the one that includes the xcodeproj file).\n\n\n\n\nType \ngem install branch_io_cli\n into terminal.\n\n\nNote\n: If you get an error saying that you don\u2019t have permissions to perform this operation, try installing with sudo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Using the CLI on a project with no third party SDKs\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType \nbr setup\n into terminal, and you\u2019ll be greeted with a few options on the following screen:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFill out your Branch Key from \nAccount Settings\n, and your app\u2019s link domain information from your \nLink Settings\n pages.\n\n\nNote\n: You don\u2019t need to add your -alternate.app.link domain.

Sign up for the Ads product to enable this functionality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable Google as an Ad Partner\n\n\nIf you haven't enabled Google as an Ad Partner on the Branch dashboard follow this section to do so.\n\n\n\n\nNavigate to the \nPartner Management tab\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch for \nGoogle AdWords\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnter values for the \nconversion IDs and labels\n. You can put in placeholders for now, but we recommend setting up install conversion tracking in AdWords before launching your campaign. For setup instructions on conversion tracking, check out \nGoogle Conversion Setup\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the \nSave and Enable\n button in the lower right hand corner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle AdWords is now enabled as an ad partner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, to create a Google ads link click the \nCreate Google AdWords Link\n button in the top right hand corner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\niOS\n\n\nCreate an Ad Link\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Branch Ad link from the \nPartner Management page\n's \nCreate Google Adwords Link\n button under the Google Adwords Partner and select \nApp Install or Engagement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the Define Section, pick a Link Name for later reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the link with the Ad Format set to \nApp Only\n, the Ad Partner set to \nGoogle Adwords\n, and the Secondary Ad Format set to \nGoogle Search Install iOS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the Configure Options tab, navigate to the Redirects sub section and ensure that the iOS redirect is set to the desired app being promoted by the ad campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the Analytics Tags sub section additional tags can be set. It is recommended to fill in these fields as they can be used as filters in Branch's Ads Analytics view. To best connect your ad link with your Adwords Campaign, set the channel field to Google Adwords and set the campaign field to the same ad campaign name used in Adwords.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting Attribution Windows\n\n\nYou can specify the attribution windows for your links either at an overall account or per link level. Use these windows to accurately measure attribution data for your Branch links. Refer to \nChanging attribution windows\n for instructions.\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Adwords Ad\n\n\nTo set up a Search Network Mobile App Install Campaign on iOS, you will need to first create your campaign and then setup a tracking template on the ad. Adwords campaign creation documentation is available \nhere\n.\n\n\nCreate Your Campaign\n\n\n\n\nSelect \nSearch Network only\n on Adwords\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the type of Search campaign select \nMobile app installs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinue setting the campaign and ad group parameters\n\n\n\n\nAd Creation\n\n\n\n\nGrab your app's iTunes App Store URL and fill it into the \nFinal URL\n field of your ad setup\n\n\nExpand the \nAd URL options\n. and place your Branch Ad link from the first section in the \nTracking template\n field. Ensure the copied link has the appropriate additional params (~campaign_id, ~ad_set_id, lpurl, etc.) which should be automatically generated on your Branch dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause the \nFinal URL\n for your app install campaigns must match your app store domain, you cannot put a Branch link in that box. However, capturing installs and deep linking users through content is still possible due to the \nTracking template\n configuration.\n\n\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\n\n\nAndroid SDK v2.10.0\n\n\nEnsure the application being promoted by the Ad campaign has the SDK version of \nv2.10.0\n or later. Starting at this version, accurate measurement of the Google Play link referrer is used which is required to support this Adwords campaign type.\n\n\n\n\nCreate an Ad Link\n\n\n\n\nCreate a Branch Ad link from the \nPartner Management page\n's \nCreate Google Adwords Link\n button under the Google Adwords Partner and select \nApp Install or Engagement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the Define Section, pick a Link Name for later reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the link with the Ad Format set to \nApp Only\n, the Ad Partner set to \nGoogle Adwords\n, and the Secondary Ad Format set to \nGoogle Search Install Android\n, while leaving the Campaign field blank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the Analytics Tags sub section additional tags can be set.

Use these windows to accurately measure attribution data for your Branch links. Refer to \nChanging attribution windows\n for instructions.\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Adwords Ad\n\n\nTo set up a Search Network Mobile App Install Campaign on Android, you will need to first create your campaign and then setup a tracking template on the ad.

Note: This link should begin with \nhttps://play.google.com\n...\n instead of the normal Branch link domain. Refer to the \nCreate A Branch Ad Link\n section if the link is not in this format to ensure the link creation was setup properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaste this Ad link into the \nFinal URL\n field\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Final URL\n\n\nGoogle Adwords current implementation of the Search Network Mobile App Install Campaign for Android \nfails to support Tracking Templates\n despite the option to set them up in the Ad creation process.\n\n\nTherefore, a unique Play Store link is used in this setup which corresponds to a Branch link. All install capturing and deep linking of content is still possible through this setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited Click Attribution\n\n\nAs of June 2017, due to the current Adwords Search Network Mobile App Install Campaign implementation, Branch's \nAndroid Click attribution\n is only measured when a user installs the mobile application.\n\n\n\n\nView Your Data\n\n\nThe \nAds Analytics Page\n on the Branch dashboard provides an interactive time series graph and table to view the performance of your Ad campaigns.\n\n\n\n\nThe table shows summary data on the performance of each Ad campaign. On the right top side of the table you can find a \ndownload button\n to retrieve the chart's content as a CSV file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteracting with your data\n\n\nBreakdown and compare aspects of your Ad campaigns' performance by using the \nCompare by +\n button to add a parameter to split the data displayed data by.\n\n\nThen use the \nand +\n button to refine the data displayed to gain deeper insight into the performance of your Ad campaigns.\n\n\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n\n\nGoogle Adwords Valuetrack Parameters\n\n\nBranch utilizes Google's Valuetrack parameters to collect more detailed information on the source of an ad click. Furthermore, we dynamically map Adword's \ncampaign id\n and \nnetwork parameters\n to a Branch link's campaign analytics \nCampaign\n and \nChannel\n tags respectively. Leave these tags blank to have them dynamically mapped.\n\n\nSee below for a table of Valuetrack parameters collected by default through Branch's Ad links and refer to the table in \nGoogle's Valuetrack docs\n for more parameters to append.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault Valuetrack Parameters on Branch Ad links\n\n\nWhat it returns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{campaignid}\n\n\nThe ad's campaign ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{adgroupid}\n\n\nThe ad's ad group ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{keyword}\n\n\nFor the Search Network: the keyword from your account that matches the search query, unless you are using a Dynamic Search ad, which returns a blank value.

Please ensure that for the Branch link you're using to track installs, Deepviews are disabled and a desktop redirect is set to either the App / Play store.\n\n\nQ: Why am I seeing inaccurate click attribution values for my Search Network Mobile App Install Campaign on Android?\n\n\nA:\n Google Adwords current implementation of the Search Network Mobile App Install Campaign for Android \nfails to support Tracking Templates\n despite the option to set them up in the Ad creation process.\n\n\nTherefore, a unique Play Store link is used in this setup which corresponds to a Branch link.

Now we're introducing a new way to track events that make reporting and analytics a whole lot better and easier.\n\n\nThe new v2 events have better tracking and analytics options in the Branch dashboard, and the new event structure makes integration with third party analytics providers quicker and tighter.\n\n\nWe're standardizing the way you track \"classes\" of events. For example: all events related to a customer purchasing are bucketed into a \"purchase\" class of data items, and all events related to users interacting with your in-app content are linked to a \"content\" class of data items.\n\n\nBelow are examples of the kinds of events you'll likely be interested in tracking, and we'll show you the way to track through our SDKs.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\nWith event tracking, it's important to track the objects related to the event occurring. Branch provides a class to describe your in-app content items  called the \nBranch Universal Object\n. For any of the events tracked below, make sure to include the universal object(s) involved. For example, if you want to track when someone purchases 3 items, you'd want to create a Branch Universal Object per item, and pass them along when tracking the event.\n\n\nRefer to the above document to set up Branch Universal Objects.\n\n\nCurrent Compatibility\n\n\nThere are a few products and features unsupported by this new method of tracking events. We clarify what's currently supported and what isn't below.\n\n\nAcceptance\n\n\nTracking these events will propagate to Ad Networks, like Criteo. For example, if you track the purchase event through Branch, this will map to Criteo's Purchase event.\n\n\nThese events will also have analytics, so you can understand their performance, using the new \nPeople-Based Attribution\n.\n\n\nLimitations\n\n\nAs of now, any calls made through these SDK methods will \nnot\n yet:\n\n\n\n\nAppear in Liveview.\n\n\nBe settable events for Data Integrations.\n\n\nBe events you can target a Journey with.\n\n\nSee Analytics on the old Analytics pipeline.

These are events like adding payment information, purchasing, viewing products, etc. If you have enabled Branch Universal Ads, these events will automatically map to certain Ad Partners. Start by creating a Branch Universal Object for each product that is associated with the event you're tracking.\n\n\nFrom there, add the Branch universal object to the tracked event, and use the right predefined constant. For example, the code snippet below is to track when a user adds to cart, but simply replace that constant with another constant to track a different event.\n\n\nA note on currency and exchange rates:\n\nIf you track commerce events without a currency, we assume they are USD. If you track commerce events with a currency other than USD, we will convert the \nrevenue\n specified to USD, using a recent exchange rate. This allows you to easily visualize revenue on the Dashboard, across many countries and currencies, because all units are USD.

Now we're introducing a new way to track events that make reporting and analytics a whole lot better and easier.  The new v2 events have better tracking and analytics options in the Branch dashboard, and the new event structure makes integration with third party analytics providers quicker and tighter.  We're standardizing the way you track \"classes\" of events. For example: all events related to a customer purchasing are bucketed into a \"purchase\" class of data items, and all events related to users interacting with your in-app content are linked to a \"content\" class of data items.  Below are examples of the kinds of events you'll likely be interested in tracking, and we'll show you the way to track through our SDKs.",

These are events like adding payment information, purchasing, viewing products, etc. If you have enabled Branch Universal Ads, these events will automatically map to certain Ad Partners. Start by creating a Branch Universal Object for each product that is associated with the event you're tracking.  From there, add the Branch universal object to the tracked event, and use the right predefined constant. For example, the code snippet below is to track when a user adds to cart, but simply replace that constant with another constant to track a different event.  A note on currency and exchange rates: \nIf you track commerce events without a currency, we assume they are USD. If you track commerce events with a currency other than USD, we will convert the  revenue  specified to USD, using a recent exchange rate. This allows you to easily visualize revenue on the Dashboard, across many countries and currencies, because all units are USD. The exchange rate is pulled from  openexchangerates.org  regularly, and is generally within an hour of the realtime exchange rate.

            "text": "People-Based Attribution\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nBranch is introducing a new and improved analytics platform for you to preview.\n\n\nWhile the most visible impact of this change is our new and visually improved Summary Graph, it is important to understand that we have fundamentally changed the underlying model we use for counting events. This is the result of consistent feedback from Branch partners who have requested we provide deeper insights and clarity around campaigns powered by Branch links. As you want to understand the events associated with clicks on Branch links beyond the course of one user session and across all types of Branch links, we developed a new attribution engine to accurately attribute user events across interaction platforms and across channels.\n\n\nThe biggest change is that we decoupled deep linking and attribution. Now you can measure the impact of events that are not directly associated with the user session in which the click occurred and this means you will now see different numbers on your Branch dashboard.\n\n\nIn some cases, a user may click a link and only open the app several hours or days later. With this new analytics platform, we are still able to attribute both the open and any subsequent events, even though we did not deep link the user.\nAlso and from now on, anytime you analyze data in the Branch dashboard, or export it out, you will see consistency in naming across all our reports and products, for all events.\n\n\nThis document highlights each of the section where you can expect to see differences between our old analytics and new People-Based Attribution.\n\n\n\n\nNo changes required\n\n\nWe've changed the entire back-end of analytics without requiring any code or implementation changes on your end.\n\n\n\n\nData Mapping\n\n\nFrom now, Branch provides you a well defined standard to keep track of and categorize events.\n\n\nThis is different than previous behavior from when you integrated the Branch SDK. Once you created and clicked links, we automatically tracked clicks, installs, opens, and web session starts and pageviews (if you installed the web SDK). If you enabled Deepviews or Journeys, we counted clicks when a click didn't actually occur, such as when a Deepview displayed, a Journey automatically opened the app without any physical click. This caused confusion on our dashboard, as users would noticed clicks occurring without anyone ever clicking a link! Fortunately, thanks to a well-defined standard and categorization of events, this will no longer be the case.\n\n\nBelow is the new classification of events. Think of when you track when a user adds payment info, and initiates a purchase, and finally completes a purchase: those are all \ncommerce\n events. Similarly, we now have \ncontent\n events and \nuser lifecycle\n events.\n\n\n\n\nimpression\n\n\nclick\n\n\nBranch CTA view\n\n\nweb to app auto redirect\n\n\nSMS sent\n\n\ninstall\n\n\nopen\n\n\nreinstall\n\n\npageview\n\n\nweb session start\n\n\ncommerce event\n\n\ncontent event\n\n\nuser lifecycle event\n\n\ncustom event\n\n\n\n\nWhat's changed?\n\n\nDeep Linking\n\n\nThe biggest change is the analytics associated with deep linking. Previously, when a user clicked your Branch links, and installed within a two hour window, they were deep linked \nand\n attributed. This means that their first time experience included your deep linked data, and we counted an install. If they installed four hours after clicking instead of two, they would not receive deep link data, and we would \nnot\n attribute this user's install.\n\n\nNow, we've separated this concept. Deep linking windows remain two hours, but attribution windows are adjustable. Going with the previous example, if someone clicks your link, and installs the app after 4 hours, they will \nnot\n receive deep link data, but will be counted as an install.\n\n\nNote: no code changes are needed, and if you want to change the deep linking window, you can do so. Read the \nattribution window\n section for more information.\n\n\nAttribution Windows\n\n\nNow that deep linking and attribution analytics are separate, we have attribution windows for analytics. As a reminder, an attribution window simply defines the window of time for  when an eligible attribution or deep link can occur. In order to make changes, navigate to the \nlink settings\n page, and scroll down to \"Attribution Window\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep Linking Duration\n refers to the duration of time someone is eligible to receive deep link data. This includes anyone clicking a Branch link, or being automatically redirected to the app through a Branch Web SDK call. Measured in minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to x\n refers to events that occur after someone clicks a Branch link. If someone clicks and installs from a link, and comes back 10 days later to purchase, we would count that as a conversion, and it would surface in our dashboard. Measured in days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpression to x\n refers to events that occur after someone views a Branch impression link. Measured in days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the default value of 2 hours for deep linking and attribution under the old system, and 2 hours for deep linking with 7 days for install attribution, here's what you can expect.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnique behavior\n\n\nWe now default every visualization in the dashboard to be unique. This means that if you are testing Branch links, and click a link 5 times, we will display that as one click. This applies to events as well. This applies to all events, as well.\n\n\nSelect visualizations also allow you to see total (i.e. non-unique) numbers as well. If you'd like to see total numbers on a visualization that does not support it, you can also export raw data.\n\n\nCutoff date\n\n\nAs far as the deployment of People-Based Attribution, we created our cut off date on October 14th 2017 and we kept the old and new analytical systems running in parallel since then and will continue to do this for a short while. This mean you can query data from any time before October 14th up until October 14th with old analytics. You can query data from October 14th onwards with both analytics. But if you wanted to do reports across this line, say, October 13th to October 15th, you would need two separate queries.\n\n\nDifferences From Cutoff Date\n\n\nIf you are tracking Purchase events, and want to see unique values for Purchases before the cut off date of October 14th 2017, those values will display as 0. This is because the Purchase event hasn't stored unique counts before October 14th. However, we are now storing this information since then.\n\n\nChanges to the Branch Dashboard\n\n\nBranch Summary Analytics\n\n\nThis section covers the changes found on the main page of the Branch \ndashboard\n.  \n\n\nInstall Summary Section\n\n\nThis is the first chart found on the main page. This chart surfaces install counts for your app using the new People-Based Analytics.\n\n\n\n\nold\n\n\n\n\nnew\n\n\nChanges\n\n\nWe've removed the pie chart from the old visualizations; this is simply removing a chart, not removing any data. You can see the same breakdowns by campaign, channel, etc on the new install summary chart, making the pie chart redundant. (See also this article on why \npie charts\n are misleading.)\n\n\nThis new install summary chart by default shows Branch only installs, that are powered by the new attribution \nwindows\n. If you want to see all installs, and not just Branch driven installs, simply click \nShow All Installs\n. You will likely notice a higher number of installs driven by Branch--this is because we have a bigger window to count an install.\n\n\nFiltering is improved on this chart, as you can add additional query logic by clicking \nAdd Compare\n and \nAdd Filter\n. Previously, you could only filter by one dimension, and now you can filter with more dimensions, with more comparisons.\n\n\nClick Flow Section\n\n\nThis section is visually the same, but different in terms of \nhow\n clicks are tracked. First, we only track unique person clicks, so if you click the same link on your device 5 times, this chart will only reflect one click. Mobile deepview views or SMS sents do not count as clicks in this chart.\n\n\nQuick Link Analytics\n\n\nJust like click flow analytics, this section is visually the same, but clicks are tracked differently. These clicks are tracked by unique counts, and follow the model where only a click is counted when someone physically taps a link. Mobile deepview views or SMS sents do not count as clicks in this chart. The data can be exported.\n\n\nSource Analytics\n\n\nVisually, you will see the query selector that is present on Install Summary. This is the same component, and it will let you drill down and add filtering logic across all events, not just installs. This data is unique as well, and can be exported.\n\n\nJourneys\n\n\nJourneys data has also changed substantially. Previously, Journeys only included paid Journeys. Now it includes all of our Web SDK's web-to-app offerings. So it also includes analytics from the .banner() and .deepview() functions.\n\n\nUniversal Ads\n\n\nUniversal Ads were introduced using the new People-Based Analytics platform, so there is no expected change. The data is unique as well, and can be exported.\n\n\nChanges to exported data\n\n\nLiveview\n\n\nLiveview hasn't changed much, but we've introduced an improved CSV export that reflects these new data models.\n\n\nData Integrations\n\n\nData Integrations now mirrors the UI of our ads flow. The data we send is also utilizing the new mechanism of attribution, meaning we will send data within a proper attribution window instead of the same session. This means more of your attributed data will make it across automatically.\n\n\nWebhooks\n\n\nWebhooks, like data integratons, is no longer session based. This means we will send more webhooks to you automatically. This update hasn't completed yet.\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\nData Speed\n\n\nThis new People-Based Analytics platform introduces a slight delay compared to the old dashboard analytics, and it may now take a few minutes for events to appear. We're continually improving the speed and plan to significantly decrease the delay in Q1 2018.\n\n\nUnique Counts\n\n\nOne thing to be aware of is that unique counts may be within a 4% window of error across the dashboard. For example, if you have 100 total clicks, and 90 were truly unique, it's possible that the dashboard could report within 4% of that 90 number. If you want true uniques, you can export raw data and de-dupe across events.\n\n\nDiffering Installs\n\n\nAs part of People-Based Attribution, your install numbers will likely not line up one to one. What this means is that if you see 200 Branch driven installs on the old Analytics Platform, it's ok to see 190 Branch driven installs (or even 210) on the same day. This is due to the way we have fundamentally changed the way we count attributions. \n\n\nSome installs on the old analytics platform were actually \"reinstalls\", but were not counted as such, which would be one reason why installs are lower. Some campaigns will count higher installs, because they may be clicked on a variety of browsers and platforms, and Branch is able to connect those touch points to accurately count an install.\n\n\nIf the difference in numbers is still concerning, reach out to your Branch account manager, or send us a message at \n\n\nNew Dashboard Accounts\n\n\nAccounts created on or after December 15th, 2017 (UTC time zone) will run exclusively on the People-Based Attribution platform.\n\n\nSupport\n\n\nDiscrepancies\n\n\nSDK Version\n\n\nWhile different install numbers are to be expected, there may be some discrepancies not related to the new attribution platform counting methodologies. You may notice numbers are off if you are on version 0.12.4 or below on the iOS SDK. If that is the case, please upgrade to the latest version of the SDK, or at least 0.12.5. There is no cut off for Android.",

While the most visible impact of this change is our new and visually improved Summary Graph, it is important to understand that we have fundamentally changed the underlying model we use for counting events. This is the result of consistent feedback from Branch partners who have requested we provide deeper insights and clarity around campaigns powered by Branch links. As you want to understand the events associated with clicks on Branch links beyond the course of one user session and across all types of Branch links, we developed a new attribution engine to accurately attribute user events across interaction platforms and across channels.  The biggest change is that we decoupled deep linking and attribution. Now you can measure the impact of events that are not directly associated with the user session in which the click occurred and this means you will now see different numbers on your Branch dashboard.  In some cases, a user may click a link and only open the app several hours or days later. With this new analytics platform, we are still able to attribute both the open and any subsequent events, even though we did not deep link the user.\nAlso and from now on, anytime you analyze data in the Branch dashboard, or export it out, you will see consistency in naming across all our reports and products, for all events.  This document highlights each of the section where you can expect to see differences between our old analytics and new People-Based Attribution.

Once you created and clicked links, we automatically tracked clicks, installs, opens, and web session starts and pageviews (if you installed the web SDK). If you enabled Deepviews or Journeys, we counted clicks when a click didn't actually occur, such as when a Deepview displayed, a Journey automatically opened the app without any physical click. This caused confusion on our dashboard, as users would noticed clicks occurring without anyone ever clicking a link! Fortunately, thanks to a well-defined standard and categorization of events, this will no longer be the case.  Below is the new classification of events. Think of when you track when a user adds payment info, and initiates a purchase, and finally completes a purchase: those are all  commerce  events. Similarly, we now have  content  events and  user lifecycle  events.   impression  click  Branch CTA view  web to app auto redirect  SMS sent  install  open  reinstall  pageview  web session start  commerce event  content event  user lifecycle event  custom event",

If they installed four hours after clicking instead of two, they would not receive deep link data, and we would  not  attribute this user's install.  Now, we've separated this concept. Deep linking windows remain two hours, but attribution windows are adjustable. Going with the previous example, if someone clicks your link, and installs the app after 4 hours, they will  not  receive deep link data, but will be counted as an install.

We recommend viewing docs on the newer \nWebhooks\n offering, which is powered by \nPeople-Based Attribution\n.\n\n\n\n\nBranch\u2019s webhook system allows you to receive install and down funnel event data from us as it occurs, for install attribution or conversion funnels in your own database. You simply need to specify a URL for us to send all this data to.\n\n\nThe webhook system is very powerful and customizable. You can register to only receive notifications for specific events, as well as specific subsections of events, filtered by link data, user data or event properties. You can specify to only receive an event for the first time a user completes it, or every time. You can also specify to only receive events in the case of referrals.\n\n\nSetup\n\n\nRegister webhook\n\n\n\n\nOpen the \nWebhooks\n page on the Branch dashboard.\n\n\nClick \n+ Add A New Webhook\n:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfigure webhook criteria\n\n\n\n\nHere are explanations of what each field on this screen controls:\n\n\n\n\nWebhook URL:\n Enter the URL where you would like the events to be sent.\n\n\nPostback Method:\n Events can be sent either via POST or GET.\n\n\nEvent Frequency:\n You can choose to receive a webhook for ever single event occurrence, or only for the first time that even is triggered for each unique user.\n\n\nEvent Trigger:\n You may select between the following default events:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninstall\n\n\nTriggered the first time a user launches your app\n\n\n\n\n\n\nopen\n\n\nTriggered whenever the app becomes active\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreferred session\n\n\nTriggered in \naddition\n to install, open or web session start if a user comes from a Branch link\n\n\n\n\n\n\nweb session start\n\n\nTriggered when the user views a webpage using the Branch Web SDK\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclick\n\n\nTriggered whenever a Branch link is clicked on any platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-- other --\n\n\nEnter an event you created through the Branch SDK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nThe \nreferred session\n and \nweb session start\n options will only appear after at least one event of that type has been recorded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter (Advanced):\n See the \nAdvanced\n page to read about customizing when events are sent.\n\n\n\n\nTesting\n\n\nTo test whether your webhook is configured correctly, you can use \nrequestb.in\n.

For example, clicking a Universal Link will open up the app directly, and therefore no browser metadata information will be present.\n\n\nEvent\n webhooks: Events are user events that either Branch generates or you generate via a call to our event tracking API.

You can configure your filters to use any webhook keyword value by using liquid tags following this convention: \n{{ param.name }}\n.\n\n\n\n\nWildcard Filtering\n\n\nIf you want to filter on just a key being present, you can put a \n*\n in the value box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Filtering installs by referring link campaign\n\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re interested in receiving a webhook for every \ninstall\n event that is referred from a Branch link where you set the \nCampaign\n field to \nApp Install Campaign\n. You would configure a filter to fire a webhook only when \n~campaign\n is equal to \nApp Install Campaign\n. The key would equal \nsession.link_data.~campaign\n and the value would equal \nApp Install Campaign\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Filtering clicks by link channel\n\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re interested in receiving a webhook for every \nclick\n event that is referred from a Branch link where you set the \nChannel\n field to \nAppLovin\n. You would configure a filter to fire a webhook only when \n~channel\n is equal to \nAppLovin\n. The key would equal \nclick.link_data.~channel\n and the value would equal \nAppLovin\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: Filtering custom signup event by location\n\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re interested in receiving a webhook for every \nsign_up\n event that is triggered via the \nuserCompletedAction\n method in the SDKs, but only in a specific market, like Chicago. Your event metadata will look something like the following:\n\n\nevent\n:\n \n{\n\n    \nname\n:\n \nsign_up\n,\n\n    \nmetadata\n:\n \n{\n\n        \ncity\n \n:\n \nChicago\n,\n\n        \nusername\n \n:\n \njohn_smith_1\n,\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nYou would configure a filter to fire a webhook only when \ncity\n is equal to \nChicago\n. The key would equal \nevent.metadata.city\n and the value would equal \nChicago\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemplating your Postback URL\n\n\nIf you plan on sending click or install data to a third party, you\u2019ll likely need to create one of our templated Postback URLs along side the aforementioned filters. These work very similarly to filters and use the same liquid tags structure: \n{{ param.name }}\n. Once the webhook is eligible, the correct value will be filled in to the slot.\n\n\n\n\nExample: Creating a dynamic conversion postback for an ad agency\n\n\nLet\u2019s say you have created a Branch link in the Ads tab specifically for SEM campaigns and you\u2019re going to give the link to an advertising agency. This ad agency wants to receive install conversion events from Branch by tracking your Branch link with specific query parameters. Your Branch link might potentially look something like this: \nhttp://branch.app.link/my-sf-campaign?clickId=12345\n.\n\n\nNow, you want to report conversions back to the agency or your backend, and you know the structure of the desired Postback URL. For example, lets say you want to send a Postback to \nhttp://myagency.com/tracking?event=install\nclickId=12345\nidfa=\n.\n\n\nWith that information, it\u2019s very easy to setup the correct, dynamic Postback URL using our templates. In this case, you need 3 fields to be dynamically populated:\n\n\n\n\nevent name\n\n\nclickId\n\n\nIDFA value\n\n\n\n\nBranch can easily populate those fields dynamically (and potentially add a lot more as described in the next section) using the following template keys:\n\n\n\n\n{{ event.name }}\n\n\n{{ session.link_click.query.clickId }}\n\n\n{{ device.hardware_id }}\n\n\n\n\nYou can create your dynamic Postback URL by using those above tags in place of where the value should go. So, in keeping with the example, the dynamic Postback URL to give to Branch would be and should be pasted into the webhook creation URL field:\n\n\n\n\nhttp://myagency.com/tracking?event={{ event.name }}\nclickId={{ session.link_click.query.clickId }}\nidfa={{ device.hardware_id }}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, since you don\u2019t want to send them \nevery\n install event, let\u2019s add a \nfilter\n to only send the installs that are referred by links which have a \nclickId\n in the query parameter. In this case, we use a wildcard parameter (\n*\n) for the key \nsession.link_click.query.clickId\n, which tells Branch to only trigger this webhook when an \ninstall\n event was referred by a link with a \nclickId\n.\n\n\n\n\nAnd with that, we\u2019re finished creating our postback!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeys available for templating/filtering \nClick\n webhooks\n\n\nWhen a Branch link is opened, triggering a \nclick\n event, you may access:\n\n\n\n\nProperties of the visitor who opened the link.\n\n\nProperties of the link that was opened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclick.query.key\n\n\nAny key that was appended to the link when opened. To retrieve \nvalue1\n from \nhttps://[branchsubdomain]/test?param1=value1\n, you would use \nclick.query.param1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclick.browser.branch_id\n\n\nThe Branch ID we have for a user's unique broswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclick.browser.metadata.userAgent\n\n\nThe user agent of the browser\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclick.device.hardware_id\n\n\nFor iOS, this is the Advertising ID. For Android, this is the Android ID\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclick.device.metadata.google_advertising_id\n\n\nAndroid only. The Google Advertising ID, if known\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclick.device.metadata.os\n\n\nThe OS of the device\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclick.device.metadata.os_version\n\n\nThe OS version\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclick.date\n\n\nTime of link click\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclick.device\n will only be available for Universal/App Links without a browser redirect. Similarly, \nclick.browser\n will only be available for non-Universal/App Links.

You would configure a filter to fire a webhook only when  ~campaign  is equal to  App Install Campaign .

These work very similarly to filters and use the same liquid tags structure:  {{ param.name }} . Once the webhook is eligible, the correct value will be filled in to the slot.   Example: Creating a dynamic conversion postback for an ad agency  Let\u2019s say you have created a Branch link in the Ads tab specifically for SEM campaigns and you\u2019re going to give the link to an advertising agency. This ad agency wants to receive install conversion events from Branch by tracking your Branch link with specific query parameters. Your Branch link might potentially look something like this:  http://branch.app.link/my-sf-campaign?clickId=12345 .  Now, you want to report conversions back to the agency or your backend, and you know the structure of the desired Postback URL. For example, lets say you want to send a Postback to  http://myagency.com/tracking?event=install clickId=12345 idfa= .  With that information, it\u2019s very easy to setup the correct, dynamic Postback URL using our templates. In this case, you need 3 fields to be dynamically populated:   event name  clickId  IDFA value   Branch can easily populate those fields dynamically (and potentially add a lot more as described in the next section) using the following template keys:   {{ event.name }}  {{ session.link_click.query.clickId }}  {{ device.hardware_id }}   You can create your dynamic Postback URL by using those above tags in place of where the value should go. So, in keeping with the example, the dynamic Postback URL to give to Branch would be and should be pasted into the webhook creation URL field:   http://myagency.com/tracking?event={{ event.name }} clickId={{ session.link_click.query.clickId }} idfa={{ device.hardware_id }}    Additionally, since you don\u2019t want to send them  every  install event, let\u2019s add a  filter  to only send the installs that are referred by links which have a  clickId  in the query parameter. In this case, we use a wildcard parameter ( * ) for the key  session.link_click.query.clickId , which tells Branch to only trigger this webhook when an  install  event was referred by a link with a  clickId .

            "text": "Facebook Ads FAQ and Advanced Options\n\n\nFAQ\n\n\nWhat is Facebook MMP?\n\n\n\"Work with a Facebook Marketing Partner to get deeper insights or measure across several ad networks\" (\nFacebook - \"Measuring for App Ads\"\n).\n\n\nThe acronym MMP is used to mean either the broad category of Facebook Mobile Marketing Partners, or more narrowly to mean Mobile Measurement Partners. The latter is a special subset of Facebook partners that have access to device-level attribution data. Branch has been vetted by Facebook and joined this group of partners in order to provide both granular analytics and true cross-channel reporting. We help you measure which installs, opens and conversion events should be attributed to Facebook ad campaigns versus other marketing efforts.\n\n\nHow does Branch attribute events to Facebook ads?\n\n\nFacebook is a self-attributing network. This means that Facebook claims credit for installs and other events. This differs from some ad networks, which send a stream of impressions and clicks that Branch then matches to events. Branch then compares these claims against other ad networks, as well as traffic coming from email, your website, and other sources, choosing the most recent click to get credit. \n\n\nThe Branch SDK already helps you track installs and other events. When you enable the Facebook MMP integration, Branch sends events and advertising IDs to Facebook. Facebook then reports whether devices previously viewed or clicked a Facebook ad, including helpful information such as campaign, ad set, and ad. As stated above, Branch then dedupes these claims against other claims for attribution.\n\n\nHow can I use deep links in Facebook ads?\n\n\nCreating a deep link is easy! First, make sure you have \nset up the integration with Facebook MMP\n on the Branch Dashboard. Then navigate to the \nFacebook page under Partner Management\n and click \"Create Facebook Link\".\n\n\nLonger instructions can be found in the guides linked to from the \nFacebook overview\n page. For example, see \nthis section of the App Installs guide\n.\n\n\nHow can I attribute conversion events to Facebook ads?\n\n\nFirst, make sure you have \nset up the integration with Facebook MMP\n on the Branch Dashboard. Second, \nset up tracking for Standard Events\n. It's that simple! We will automatically attribute events to Facebook ads. \n\n\nThere are advanced options for tracking events, which you can read more about \nbelow\n.\n\n\nWhat are the permissions you ask for as part of the onboarding process, and why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermissions (OAuth scopes)\n\n\nWhy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nads_read\n\n\nPulling marketing insights data (e.g. impressions, clicks) to present on the Branch Dashboard. Also used for pulling creative name and id, etc., to provide richer analytics for installs, opens and other events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbusiness_management\n\n\n(1) We pull in ad accounts for you to choose from. (2) At the end of the login process, we add our System User to your business and ad account with REPORTS_ONLY permissions. Then we will no longer store the access token that has both of these permissions (ads_read and business_management). In the future, we can easily quarantine/decommission the System User if we detect unusual or unauthorized activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is each piece of information needed during the onboarding process, and why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifier\n\n\nWhy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAd account\n\n\nPulling marketing insights data (e.g. impressions, clicks) to present on the Branch Dashboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook App ID\n\n\nSending installs, opens and other events to Facebook in order to see whether they were driven by a Facebook ad campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm having problems finding or choosing the correct ad account(s)\n\n\nThe ad account I want to select is greyed out\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not an admin of the \nbusiness\n linked to an ad account, you will not be able to add it. This is because we will not be able to add our System User for attribution and analytics purposes. To check whether you are a business admin, please visit the \nbusiness's settings page\n. If you can see yourself listed, and you can see that your role is shown as admin (see image below), you should be able to complete setup. Otherwise, please request that an admin at your business complete the setup on the Branch Dashboard.\n\n\n\n\nIf you still have questions, please \ncontact us\n and include \"Facebook MMP + Business Admin\" in the subject.\n\n\nI see a warning underneath my ad account saying that I need to be an admin\n\n\n\n\nIf an ad account is not linked to a business, then we cannot guarantee that this account setup will succeed. Please visit \nthe ad account settings page\n, navigate to the appropriate ad account, and ensure you are an admin (see image below). \n\n\n\n\nIf you still have questions, please \ncontact us\n and include \"Facebook MMP + Standalone Ad Account(s)\" in the subject.\n\n\nI can't see the ad account I want to use at all\n\n\nPlease try logging out and logging back in on Facebook. Note the email address that you use. If you still do not see ad accounts, please visit \nbusiness.facebook.com\n and ensure that you use the same email address / Facebook account. If you still cannot figure this out, please \ncontact us\n and include \"Facebook MMP + Missing Ad Account(s)\" in the subject.\n\n\nWhat is the difference between your previous Facebook Ads product, and the new Facebook Ads product?\n\n\nBranch is now a Facebook Mobile Measurement Partner (MMP). This means we are partnering with Facebook to more accurately attribute your installs, opens and custom events back to Facebook ad campaigns! \n\n\nThe major differences: we can use this product \nwithout\n a Branch deep link. No need to manually create Branch links and add them to Facebook ads! \n\n\nIf you use a Branch deep link, we will still return the Branch deep link information in app so that you can deep link your users to content. Attributed events will \nnot\n have the Branch deep link information, but rather the Facebook ad campaign information. This info cannot be passed along to third parties via our Data Integrations.\n\n\nDoes Branch provide view-through (impression) attribution for Facebook?\n\n\nBranch is able to provide device-level view-through attribution for installs only, for up to 24 hours from impression to install. This is what is available via the MMP API that Facebook has exposed. It's also possible that if other app events (such as opens) occur shortly after an install, we can attribute those back to the same impression/view.\n\n\nHow do I upgrade from the old Facebook integration to the new Facebook integration?\n\n\nEasy. Navigate to \nFacebook within the Ads Management portal\n. Choose \"Connect with Facebook\" and follow the guide to \nset up the integration with Facebook MMP\n.\n\n\nThe moment you complete this signup flow, we will upgrade you to getting the full MMP functionality! Now installs and other analytics will include info on campaign, ad set, ad, and creative from Facebook.\n\n\nI think I previously had Facebook enabled...\n\n\n...but now when I navigate to \nFacebook within the Ads Management portal\n, I just see \"Connect with Facebook\". What gives?\n\n\nWe've hidden the old Facebook setup flow. Please choose \"Connect with Facebook\" and follow the guide to \nset up the integration with Facebook MMP\n.\n\n\nThe previous signup flow is no longer supported. If for some reason you need to access the previous signup flow, please \ncontact us\n and include \"Facebook MMP + legacy signup flow\" in the subject.\n\n\nWhat happens to campaigns in which I'm using deep links?\n\n\nWe still highly recommend you use links in ads. \nStudies have shown\n that when you deep link your users, they have a better experience and retention is higher!\n\n\nWhen you put a Branch link in a Facebook ad, we still return this link to your app, so that users can be deep linked. Deep linking functions exactly as it did before.\n\n\nDo I need to remove deep links from my Facebook ads.\n\n\nNo. In fact we recommend you use deep links. See the previous question.\n\n\nDoes this new Facebook MMP functionality cover web campaigns?\n\n\nGenerally, no. Facebook MMP allows us to measure Facebook app install and app engagement ads. However, in some cases, we are able to attribute web events that occur \nafter\n an app install/engagement ad \nback\n to that ad. This is because we can link together web and app user identifiers as part of our People-Based Attribution product.\n\n\nCan I get the data out?\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nData Integrations will never include events attributed to Facebook. This is because we cannot share device-level Facebook attribution data with third parties.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many ways to access data pertaining to Facebook. \n\n\nYou can see analytics on impressions, clicks, installs, opens and conversion events on various pages of the \nBranch Dashboard\n, as well as the \nQuery API\n.\n\n\nIf you have signed Facebook's \n\"Advanced Mobile Measurement\" agreement (\"Data Use Terms for Advanced Mobile App Measurement\")\n, then you can get device level data out via \nWebhooks\n, the \nData Export API\n, and \nCSV Exports\n. If you have not signed this agreement, any event attributed to a Facebook ad will look like an organic event when accessed via Webhooks, the Data Export API, and CSV Exports.\n\n\nWe cannot send device-level Facebook attribution data to third parties. Thus we cannot send events attributed to Facebook via Data Integrations. Please instead consider analyzing this data in-house (using Webhooks, the Data Export API, or CSV Exports), or using the Branch Dashboard for all of your analytics and attribution needs. If you have analytics needs that are not met by the Branch Dashboard, please \ncontact us\n and include \"Facebook MMP + Feature Request\" in the subject.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch feature\n\n\nFacebook data included\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDashboard visualizations\n\n\nPre-aggregated analytics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuery API\n\n\nPre-aggregated analytics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiveview\n\n\nDevice-level analytics *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Export API\n\n\nDevice-level analytics *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSV Exports\n\n\nDevice-level analytics *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWebhooks\n\n\nDevice-level analytics *\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Integrations\n\n\nNot supported\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(*) You must have signed you have signed Facebook's \n\"Advanced Mobile Measurement\" agreement (\"Data Use Terms for Advanced Mobile App Measurement\")\n to view this data\n\n\nHere is the page where you can see which ad accounts have signed the AMM agreement:\n\n\n\n\nThe data on Facebook and the data on Branch does not line up!\n\n\nPlease see the section below, \nSources of Discrepancies between Facebook and Branch\n.\n\n\nFacebook Ads Advanced Options\n\n\nFacebook MMP event options\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\nTo see the options below on the Branch Dashboard, \nclick here\n.\n\n\n\n\nBranch + Facebook MMP allows you to attribute events back to your Facebook ad campaigns. Branch sends events to Facebook, along with metadata including advertising ID. Facebook then returns info on the ad that the user last viewed or clicked, if any. Branch then surfaces this on our Dashboard, and conditionally* makes this data available in our \nData Feeds\n product.\n\n\nPartners have several options when it comes to sending events to Facebook. These are discussed below.\n\n\n(*) You must have signed the \nData Use Terms for Advanced Mobile App Measurement\n\n\nTracking installs\n\n\nBranch sends all installs to Facebook. Facebook de-duplicates installs on their end. If you have the Facebook SDK and/or another MMP, these also send installs to Facebook's backend. This will not result in duplicate installs, since Facebook de-dupes them.\n\n\nTracking reinstalls and opens\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nFacebook does not de-duplicate custom app events on their backend. So if you have the Facebook SDK integrated or another MMP tracking app opens, choose option 1 below.\n\n\n\n\nWhen tracking reinstalls and opens, you have 3 options:\n\n\n\n\nuse Branch name (branch_open)\n: This allows us to get attribution data from Facebook, but without it counting as an app open. Use this option if you have the Facebook SDK integrated or are testing with another MMP. Since the Facebook SDK or other MMP is already sending fb_mobile_activate_app, you do not want Branch to send this a second time. (Default)\n\n\nuse Facebook name (fb_mobile_activate_app)\n: Branch will send the exact event used by Facebook for tracking app opens. Use this option if you do not have the Facebook SDK and you are not tracking opens with another MMP, and you would like Branch to help Facebook record opens.\n\n\ndisable\n: Use this option if you do not want Branch attributing opens at all. In some cases, we may still be able to attribute opens based on previously retrieved attribution data from Facebook. But we will not send any opens to Facebook in order to get attribution data back.\n\n\n\n\nTracking other conversion events\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nFacebook does not de-duplicate custom app events on their backend. If you are tracking conversion events with the Facebook SDK or another MMP, choose option 1 below.\n\n\n\n\nIt's possible to track app events using only Branch! You can \ntrack the events\n with Branch once, and then we send them to Facebook as well as other analytics systems. Use the \nv2/event logging methods\n outlined here.\n\n\nWhen tracking add to cart, purchase, and other Facebook app events, you have 3 options:\n\n\n\n\nuse Branch name\n: This allows us to get attribution data from Facebook, but without it counting as a purchase, add to cart, etc. Use this option if you have the Facebook SDK integrated or are testing with another MMP, and you already track app events via one of those two methods. Since the Facebook SDK or other MMP is already sending events to Facebook, you do not want Branch to send these a second time. (Default)\n\n\nuse Facebook name\n: Branch will send the exact event used by Facebook for tracking app events. Use this option if you are not already tracking app events with the Facebook SDK or another MMP, and you would like Branch to help Facebook record these events.\n\n\ndisable\n: Use this option if you do not want Branch attributing these conversion events. In some cases, we may still be able to attribute these conversion events based on previously retrieved attribution data from Facebook. But we will not send any conversion events to Facebook in order to get attribution data back.\n\n\n\n\nMapping of Branch event names to Facebook events\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch event name\n\n\nFacebook MMP _eventName\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACHIEVE_LEVEL\n\n\nfb_mobile_level_achieved\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADD_PAYMENT_INFO\n\n\nfb_mobile_add_payment_info\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADD_TO_CART\n\n\nfb_mobile_add_to_cart\n\n\n\n\n\n\nADD_TO_WISHLIST\n\n\nfb_mobile_add_to_wishlist\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE_REGISTRATION\n\n\nfb_mobile_complete_registration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPLETE_TUTORIAL\n\n\nfb_mobile_tutorial_completion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINITIATE_PURCHASE\n\n\nfb_mobile_initiated_checkout\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPURCHASE\n\n\nfb_mobile_purchase\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRATE\n\n\nfb_mobile_rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEARCH\n\n\nfb_mobile_search\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPEND_CREDITS\n\n\nfb_mobile_spent_credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNLOCK_ACHIEVEMENT\n\n\nfb_mobile_achievement_unlocked\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIEW_ITEM\n\n\nfb_mobile_content_view\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapping of Branch metadata to Facebook metadata\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch Key-Value Pair\n\n\nFacebook MMP Key-Value Pair\n\n\nFacebook event(s) supported\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommerce_data.revenue\n\n\n_valueToSum\n\n\nfb_mobile_add_to_cart, fb_mobile_add_to_wishlist, fb_mobile_initiated_checkout, fb_mobile_purchase, fb_mobile_spent_credits, fb_mobile_content_view\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommerce_data.currency\n\n\nfb_currency\n\n\nfb_mobile_add_to_cart, fb_mobile_add_to_wishlist, fb_mobile_initiated_checkout, fb_mobile_purchase, fb_mobile_content_view\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontent_items[0].$sku\n\n\nfb_content_id\n\n\nfb_mobile_add_to_cart, fb_mobile_add_to_wishlist, fb_mobile_tutorial_completion, fb_mobile_initiated_checkout, fb_mobile_purchase, fb_mobile_rate, fb_mobile_spent_credits, fb_mobile_content_view\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontent_items[0].$product_category\n\n\nfb_content_type\n\n\nfb_mobile_add_to_cart, fb_mobile_add_to_wishlist, fb_mobile_initiated_checkout, fb_mobile_purchase, fb_mobile_rate, fb_mobile_search, fb_mobile_spent_credits, fb_mobile_content_view\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontent_items[0].$quantity\n\n\nfb_num_items\n\n\nfb_mobile_initiated_checkout, fb_mobile_purchase\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontent_items[0].$rating\n\n\n_valueToSum\n\n\nfb_mobile_rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontent_items[0].$rating_max\n\n\nfb_max_rating_value\n\n\nfb_mobile_rate\n\n\n\n\n\n\nevent_data.search_query\n\n\nfb_search_string\n\n\nfb_mobile_search\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontent_items[0].$og_description\n\n\nfb_description\n\n\nfb_mobile_achievement_unlocked\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncustom_data.fb_payment_info_available\n\n\nfb_payment_info_available\n\n\nfb_mobile_initiated_checkout\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncustom_data.level\n\n\nfb_level\n\n\nfb_mobile_level_achieved\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncustom_data.fb_success\n\n\nfb_success\n\n\nfb_mobile_add_payment_info, fb_mobile_tutorial_completion, fb_mobile_search\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncustom_data.fb_registration_method\n\n\nfb_registration_method\n\n\nfb_mobile_complete_registration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently Facebook appears to only support sending one fb_content_id (etc) per event, whereas Branch allows you to send many. To provide as much functionality as possible, we choose the first content_item and search it for key-value pairs that can be sent to Facebook.\n\n\nTracking custom events\n\n\nIn addition to tracking installs and Facebook app events (see \nTracking other conversion events\n above), you can also have Branch attribute custom events. To do so, we must send those events to Facebook.\n\n\nWhen tracking custom events that have no equivalent \nFacebook App Event\n, you have 2 options:\n\n\n\n\nenable\n: Branch will send custom events to Facebook. this allows us to get attribution data from Facebook. (default)\n\n\ndisable\n: Use this option if you do not want Branch attributing custom events. In some cases, we may still be able to attribute these custom events based on previously retrieved attribution data from Facebook. But we will not send any custom events to Facebook in order to get attribution data back. \n\n\n\n\nMigrating from the existing Facebook integration to MMP\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can no longer see the previous Facebook onboarding flow that required you to copy-paste your Facebook app secret. Please use the \"Authenticate with Facebook\" option instead.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have been using our integration with Facebook prior to February 14, 2018, then we highly recommend that you upgrade to our new integration that includes MMP. \n\n\nWe are now certified by Facebook as a Mobile Measurement Partner! Branch can now help you attribute installs, opens, and conversion events to Facebook like never before.\n\n\nThis integration includes full support for Facebook, Instagram, and the Audience Network. We also automatically pull in impressions and clicks from Facebook and surface those alongside your clicks on Branch links. The deep linking experience your users love is still supported. \n\n\nInstructions on how to get set up with Facebook MMP are \nhere\n. Note that this will replace your existing credentials on our backend. Instead of copy-pasting your Facebook app secret into the Branch Dashboard, you can now simply click through the normal Facebook login flow.\n\n\nBranch will now automatically surface Facebook campaign, ad set, and ad information on the Branch Dashboard's visualizations! This isn't limited to \nAds Analytics\n -- it also includes cross-channel analytics such as \nSource Analytics\n.\n\n\nSources of Discrepancies between Facebook and Branch\n\n\nWhen using Branch as your Facebook MMP, you may notice some data discrepancies between the Branch dashboard and the Facebook dashboard if not configured correctly. We have highlighted several sources of discrepancies if they are present after you have onboarded with Facebook on the Branch dashboard. \n\n\nThere are many reasons why you may see different numbers on Facebook and Branch. Please note that we have one system for tracking impressions and clicks (via the Facebook Insights API) and a different system for tracking installs, reinstalls, opens and conversion events (via a private Facebook API). When trying to figure out differences, it's best to pick one event at a time (e.g. clicks or installs) and focus on causes of discrepancies there.\n\n\nThe first two sections below covers common causes of discrepancies: attribution windows and timezones. The following sections then provide more steps on diagnosing and troubleshooting specific problems.\n\n\nAttribution Windows\n\n\nAn attribution window is the maxiumum amount of time between an initial action (click or impression) and a conversion event (install or open) for which you attribute that conversion event as occuring \nbecause of\n that initial action.\n\n\nExample with 3 day view attribution window: If a user views your ad and 2 days later installs your app, that install would be attributed to that ad view. However if the user views your ad and 4 days later installs the app, that install would be considered an organic install and would NOT be attributed to that ad view.  You can read more in our documentation \nhere\n\n\nIf one of your attribution windows on the Branch dashboard is different than the corresponding window on the Facebook dashboard, the data between the two will not align. You can mitigate this by changing one of more of your attribution windows on the Branch dashboard, or changing your Facebook dashboard for the given ad account.\n\n\nThere are four Branch attribution windows, and two Facebook attribution windows. This chart shows which Facebook window name each Branch window name corresponds to:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch window name\n\n\nFacebook window name\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to install\n\n\nClick Window\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to session start\n\n\nClick Window\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to conversion event\n\n\nClick Window\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpression to install\n\n\nView Window\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpression to session start\n\n\nView Window\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpression to conversion event\n\n\nView Window\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange your Facebook attribution windows\n\n\nIn order to update your Facebook Attribution window for a particular ad account, you can go to \nhttps://business.facebook.com/ads/manager/account_settings/information\n. Choose the account in the dropdown in the upper-left corner. As long as you're an admin on that account, you should see a section 'Attribution' at the top-right, and an ability to edit the Click or View window or both.\n\n\nChange your Branch attribution windows\n\n\nAlternatively or in addition, you could update any of your four Branch attribution windows. To do so go to the \nLink Settings\n section of the Branch dashboard, and scroll down to the 'Attribution Windows' section and expand it. Alter any of the four windows listed in the chart above to match the corresponding Facebook window, and then save at the bottom of the page.\n\n\nReporting based on time of impression or time of conversion\n\n\nFacebook and Branch may report the same install as occurring on different days, if the impression is on one day but the install is on another day.\n\n\nBackground:\n\n\nFacebook by defaults reports installs based on the day that the impression occurred. They also allow you to see reports based on the day that the install occurred.\n\n\nBranch always reports installs based on the date of install, never the date of impression.\n\n\nLet's illustrate this with a scenario:\n\n\nUser views an ad on Apil 1, clicks it, then installs the app on April 2.\n\n\nBy default, Facebook reports the install as occurring on April 1. However, when pulling data from the insights API, you can specify option action_report_time=conversion. This causes Facebook to report that the install occurred on April 2.\n\n\nBranch will always report the install as having occurred on April 2.\n\n\nTimezones\n\n\nPlease make sure the timezone is the same for your Facebook ad account and your Branch account. \n\n\nYou can see the timezone used by your Branch account \nhere\n.\n\n\nYou can see the timezone used by your Facebook ad account \nhere\n. If you are using multiple ad accounts with Branch, be sure to align the timezones of each of them.\n\n\nIf you are unable to align all timezones, you may notice some data on the Branch Dashboard does not line up exactly with data on the Facebook Dashboard. However, data will not be lost, but merely shifted between days. Summing figures over longer periods of time should greatly diminish the effect of having inconsistent time zones.\n\n\nOther common issues\n\n\nIssue with iOS 10+ and Limit Ad Tracking\n\n\nIn iOS 10, Apple broke the ability for app developers to collect the \nIDFA\n if the user had enabled \nLimit Ad Tracking\n. In this case, Branch and Facebook cannot compare notes to see who drove the install. This will account for about 15% discrepancy in counts across both platforms, where Branch's tracked installs will be lower.\n\n\nNot Collecting Advertising ID\n\n\nIf you see absolutely 0 data coming through from your integration, it's possible that you're not collecting Google Advertising ID (GAID) on Android or IDFA on iOS.\n\n\n\n\niOS: Add the AdSupport.framework and read this extra info about \nsubmitting\n to the store.\n\n\nAndroid: Add Google Play Services so that we can collect GAID. See \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nInstalls Counted as Reinstalls, Opens on Branch\n\n\nOne discrepancy root cause we've seen before is the scenario where Branch will classify an install as a reinstall or open. We remember the history of a particular user via their IDFA or Google Advertising ID (in addition to using a few other methods) and will detect whether the user is actually a new user or a returning user who had previously uninstalled your app. Facebook has a different mechanism that is limited to 180 days. Branch in some cases has detected reinstalls that occurred more than a year later.\n\n\nDon't Use setDebug\n\n\nFacebook ads are incompatible with \ndebug mode\n, as this prevents us from sending the correct hardware ID to Facebook.\n\n\nRenaming campaigns, ad sets, and ads\n\n\nIf you rename a campaign, ad set, ad, or creative on the Facebook dashboard, then it can result in weird discrepancies between Branch and Facebook. If you change the campaign name, for example, Branch will nearly immediately start tracking all new installs (and other events) using the new campaign name. However, we will not reclassify existing events as having the new campaign name.\n\n\nRest assured, however, that we are treating the data properly. Though we do not expose it on our Dashboard as of early 2018, we also track data by campaign id, ad set id, ad id, and creative id. These do not change with a rename. You can view this data using and of our \nData Feeds\n products!\n\n\nDiscrepancies with Impressions and Clicks\n\n\n1. I don't see any clicks or installs on the Branch Dashboard\n\n\nFirst, be sure you've set up the Facebook integration! Work through \nthese steps\n and ensure you reach the bottom. You should have at least one ad account enabled, and a Facebook app id listed.\n\n\nSecond, make sure you're running ads that are resulting in installs, reinstalls, or opens. Once you see installs, you should shortly start seeing clicks. For more, see the next FAQ item.\n\n\nIf you're unable to see installs, reinstalls, or opens on the Branch Dashboard, skip down to the section below: \nI don't see any installs, reinstalls or opens on the Branch Dashboard\n.\n\n\n2. I see installs on the Facebook Dashboard, but no clicks\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBranch will only show impressions and clicks for campaigns that have installs, reinstalls, or opens. If you have campaigns that have not resulted in these app-based outcomes, we will hide them. This is to prevent massively inflating analytics on the Branch Dashboard with data that is not relevant. If you have feedback on this, please \ncontact us\n and include \"Facebook MMP + clicks\" in the subject.\n\n\n\n\nIf you turned on the integration within the last hour, then you may need to refresh the Branch Dashboard to see clicks. We automatically start a background job to pull in impressions and clicks from Facebook the first time you visit the \nAds Analytics\n page after enabling Facebook.\n\n\nIf it has been longer than an hour since you (1) enabled the MMP integration then (2) visited the Ads Analytics page then (3) pressed refresh and (4) see installs but still no clicks, then please \ncontact us\n and put \"Facebook MMP + 0 clicks\" in the subject. Please include: \n\n\n\n\nBranch app id\n\n\nFacebook ad account id\n\n\nOne Facebook campaign name for which you have clicks and installs\n\n\nDate range\n\n\nFor every day in date range, the number of clicks Facebook is reporting for this campaign - include both a table and a screenshot\n\n\nFor every day in date range, the number of installs Facebook is reporting for this campaign - include both a table and a screenshot\n\n\n\n\n3. I see clicks on the Branch Dashboard, but the numbers look different from what I see on the Facebook Dashboard.\n\n\nIf you are looking at impressions/clicks for the current day:\n\n\nIf the numbers line up pretty closely between Branch and Facebook, then it's possible the Facebook numbers are slightly more recent. The Facebook Insights API refreshes every 15 minutes. Branch tries to pull updated numbers as often as possible.\n\n\nIf the numbers do not line up closely, but you recently started a new campaign, it may be that Branch has not yet pulled in data for that campaign. The numbers should line up much more closely within an hour. If they do not, then please \ncontact us\n and put \"Facebook MMP + Click Dicrepancies\" in the subject. Please include: \n\n\n\n\nBranch app id\n\n\nFacebook ad account id\n\n\nOne Facebook campaign name for which you have clicks and installs\n\n\nDate range\n\n\nFor every day in date range, the number of clicks Facebook is reporting for this campaign - include both a table and a screenshot\n\n\nFor every day in date range, the number of installs Facebook is reporting for this campaign - include both a table and a screenshot \n\n\n\n\nIf you are looking at impressions/clicks for a past day:\n\n\nWhen you initially enable the Facebook integration, then visit the \nAds Analytics\n page, Branch will start fetching impressions and clicks for the most recent several days. If you go back beyond 7 days, we may not have impressions and click data. If you need this data, please \ncontact us\n and include \"Facebook MMP + Loading Old Clicks\" in the subject. Please include:\n\n\n\n\nBranch app id\n\n\nFacebook ad account id\n\n\nOne Facebook campaign name for which you have clicks and installs\n\n\nDate range\n\n\n\n\nDiscrepancies with Installs, Opens and Conversion Events\n\n\n1. I don't see any installs, reinstalls or opens on the Branch Dashboard\n\n\nFirst, be sure you've set up the Facebook integration! Work through \nthese steps\n and ensure you reach the bottom. You should have at least one ad account enabled, and a Facebook app id listed.\n\n\nSecond, make sure you're running ads that are resulting in installs, reinstalls, or opens.\n\n\nThird, on the Facebook Dashboard, locate a campaign with installs, reinstalls, or opens. Determine the ad account id for which you are running an app campaign. Then navigate to the \nFacebook page under Partner Management\n and make sure that ad account id is listed as part of the completed signup process. It should appear here (two ad accounts are shown as enabled in the screenshot, though the ad account ids are blurred out):\n\n\n\n\nFourth, make sure you have installs, reinstalls, or opens that have occurred after you enabled the Branch + Facebook integration. We cannot pull historical device-level data, as that's not how the Facebook APIs are architected. You should enable Branch + Facebook, wait for new installs to occur, then check the \nAds Analytics\n page.\n\n\nIf after all this you're still not seeing installs, please \ncontact us\n and include \"Facebook MMP + 0 installs\" in the subject. Please include:\n\n\n\n\nBranch app id\n\n\nFacebook ad account id\n\n\nOne Facebook campaign name for which you have installs\n\n\nDate range\n\n\nFor every day in date range, the number of installs Facebook is reporting - include both a table and a screenshot\n\n\n\n\n2. I see installs, reinstalls or opens on the Branch Dashboard, but the numbers look different from what I see on the Facebook Dashboard\n\n\nIf you've made it this far, the integration between Branch + Facebook is at least somewhat functional! Time to identify why numbers are not lining up.\n\n\nTry comparing (1) just installs, and (2) just for one campaign. On the Branch \nAds Analytics\n page, you can view data for just one campaign by choosing \"Add Filter\", selecting \"campaign\" from the first dropdown, and the individual campaign name from the second dropdown. Again, try to get numbers to line up between Facebook and Branch just for installs on one campaign.\n\n\nFirst, make sure the attribution windows line up between Facebook and Branch. You can read more on this \nabove\n.\n\n\nSecond, make sure the timezones line up between Facebook and Branch. You can read more on this \nabove\n.\n\n\nNote that attribution windows are not applied to events that occurred in the past. So if you have a 30-day attribution window for click-to-install on Branch, and a 7-day window for clicks on Facebook, once you change the Branch click-to-install attribution window to 7 days, it will not automatically update historical numbers. Instead, you'll need to wait for new installs to occur under the stricter 7-day Branch click-to-install attribution window. The next day you should be able to come back and look at just the current day's install numbers, and they should line up more closely.\n\n\nIf after all this you're still seeing discrepancies, please \ncontact us\n and include \"Facebook MMP + Install Discrepancies\" in the subject. Please include:\n\n\n\n\nBranch app id\n\n\nFacebook ad account id\n\n\nOne Facebook campaign name for which you have clicks and installs\n\n\nDate range\n\n\nYour Facebook attribution window - include both a table and a screenshot\n\n\nFor every day in date range, the number of installs Facebook is reporting - include both a table and a screenshot\n\n\nFor every day in date range, the number of installs Branch is reporting - include both a table and a screenshot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIn some rare cases, we've seen partners running multiple Facebook campaigns with the same name. In this case, the Branch Dashboard will combine stats for all of these campaigns under the same name. We still retain this data separately on our backend, as there are different Facebook campaign ids. While we do not expose this on the Branch Dashboard, you can pull statistics by campaign id via the \nQuery API\n.\n\n\n\n\n3. I don't see any conversion events on the Branch Dashboard\n\n\nBe sure you are tracking v2/events - \nlearn more from our v2/event docs\n.\n\n\nBe sure you are opting to send conversion events to Facebook - learn more from the section \nFacebook MMP event options\n above.\n\n\nBe reasonably confident that users coming from Facebook ads are completing conversion events. If you have, for example, only a small percentage of users completing purchases, and only a small percentage of users downloading your app from Facebook, it's possible that there is no overlap between users making purchases and users coming from Facebook.\n\n\nIf after all this you're still seeing discrepancies, please \ncontact us\n and include \"Facebook MMP + Install Discrepancies\" in the subject. Please include:\n\n\n\n\nBranch app id\n\n\nFacebook ad account id\n\n\nOne Facebook campaign name for which you have clicks and installs\n\n\nDate range\n\n\nYour Facebook attribution window - include both a table and a screenshot\n\n\nFor every day in date range, the number of installs Facebook is reporting - include both a table and a screenshot\n\n\nFor every day in date range, the number of installs Branch is reporting - include both a table and a screenshot\n\n\nFor every day in date range, the number of conversion events Facebook is reporting - include both a table and a screenshot\n\n\nFor every day in date range, the number of conversion events Branch is reporting - include both a table and a screenshot\n\n\n\n\n4. I see conversion events on the Branch Dashboard, but the numbers look different from what I see on the Facebook Dashboard\n\n\nWe have not encountered any issues here so far. Please see \nI see installs, reinstalls or opens on the Branch Dashboard, but the numbers look different from what I see on the Facebook Dashboard\n for steps to follow, and for information to send to us if we need to debug together.\n\n\nTroubleshooting deep linking\n\n\nIntercepting Deep Links Before Branch\n\n\nIf you use Branch deep links in Facebook app ads, please check the following.\n\n\nWe recently discovered an issue where an app was calling Facebook's SDK to fetch the deferred app link within their iOS and Android app. Branch calls uses this same mechanism via a direct API integration, but if Facebook's SDK retrieves it before we do, Branch will not see any deep link data. Please ensure to comment out any calls to the following API within your app:\n\n\n\n\nAndroid: fetchDeferredAppLink\n\n\niOS: fetchDeferredAppLink\n\n\n\n\nTesting Deep Linking from Ads\n\n\nUnfortunately, the demo/preview ads used during the ads creation flow on Facebook use a different mechanism than live Facebook ads. \nThis prevents you from testing deep linking from your Facebook ads\n. Do not waste time trying to get this to work. We've confirmed with Facebook representatives that this is broken.\n\n\nThe only way to test the deep linking functionality is outside of the actual ads system is a helper tool from Facebook. Follow these instructions to test the deep linking functionality:\n\n\n\n\nHead to the \nAds tester tool\n\n\nChoose the app that you're advertising with\n\n\nScroll down to the button that says 'Test Deep Link'\n\n\nPaste in the Branch link\n\n\nCheck 'Send Deferred'\n\n\nClick 'Send to iOS/Android'\n\n\nInstall the app and it should deep link!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the following common mistakes for testing\n\n\n\n\nIf you reset the GAID or IDFA on a device, you must uninstall Facebook and re-install prior to testing. Facebook does not update the IDFA/GAID every time it's opened.\n\n\nSend deferred does not require a notification to be sent or to be clicked. Checking \"Send Deferred\" will automatically queue up a match for the test device with the deep link data. The notifiation is completely separate from deferred deep linking.\n\n\nThe Facebook account on the desktop where you click \"Send Deferred\" must match the account logged into the test device for deferred deep link data to be queued up. Note that we've observed issues where you log in and out of multiple accounts on test devices that cause Facebook to not correctly queue up a match.\n\n\nIf you see that someone liked your ad, do not bother trying to click and test it. Clicking your own, live advertisement that shows up in notifications will not deep link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssues Reading Facebook App Links\n\n\nIf Facebook is having trouble reading the App Links from the Branch link, you might see messages like these while trying to test out the flow. This means that there is something corrupted in the OG tags causing Facebook to not parse your link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRescrape the OG Tags\n\n\nYou can test the OG tags using the \nOG tag tester tool\n provided by Facebook:\n\n\n\n\nPaste the Branch Link into the Input URL box.\n\n\nClick on the Show existing scrape information button.\n\n\nExamine errors regarding App Links from the output window.\n\n\nClick on the Fetch New Scrape Information button. This last step typically resolves this problem if you are certain that your Branch Link Settings are correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can further automate the rescraping process by using this command after you create a new link and before you use it for any ads:\n\n\ncurl --insecure \nhttps://graph.facebook.com/?id=[YOUR-URL-TO-SCRAPE]\nscrape=true\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the OG tag tester continues to report problems\n\n\n\n\nExamine your \nLink Settings\n and ensure that for all platforms (for which an app is available), that a URI scheme and a link to the app in the Play/App Store is configured. If you are using a Custom URL for your iOS Redirect, then you need to append \n?id[10-digit App Store ID]\n to the URL. This is necessary in order to fully generate the App Links and OG tags that the Facebook scraper expects to find.\n\n\nFor example, if your App Store URL is \nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-app-name/id1234567890\n, then your Custom URL value should be \nhttps://example.com?id1234567890\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf errors from the output window pertain to OG tags i.e. missing title, description etc. then examine link OG tags by appending \n?debug=true\n as described on the \nIntegration Testing page\n.\n\n\nIf you haven't set OG tags on a per link level, then please check your Dashboard's global Social Media Display Customization settings from the \nLink Settings\n page.\n\n\n\n\nUse a direct deep link\n\n\nAs a last resort, you can manually input a direct deep link. To retrieve this:\n\n\n\n\nGo to Facebook's \nOpen Graph Object Debugger\n\n\nInput the Branch link you want to use for your ad\n\n\nClick \nFetch new scrape information\n\n\nFind the \nal:ios:url\n line (it should look like \nmeta property=\"al:ios:url\" content=\"myapp://open?link_click_id=link-242052337263342024\" /\n)\n\n\nCopy the value of this (\nmyapp://open?link_click_id=link-242052337263342024\n) and input it as the Deep Link value of your ad\n\n\n\n\nIf none of these approaches work, please reach out to \n immediately.\n\n\nKnown Issue with App Restrictions\n\n\nWe recently discovered a bug within the Facebook system that prevents App Links from being read by the robot if you change any of these values from the defaults in your Advanced Facebook App Settings tab. Please make sure\n\n\n\n\nContains Alcohol is set to \nNo\n\n\nAge Restriction is set to \nAnyone (13+)\n\n\nSocial Discovery is set to \nYes\n\n\nCountry Restricted is set to \nNo\n\n\n\n\nIt has to look like this \nexactly\n:\n\n\n\n\nNo IP Whitelists\n\n\nBecause Branch has a large distribution of API servers that will be making requests to Facebook on behalf of your app, you cannot have an IP whitelist in your \nFacebook advanced settings\n and still have this integration work. Please remove any IPs from this setting if they are present.",

Please note that we have one system for tracking impressions and clicks (via the Facebook Insights API) and a different system for tracking installs, reinstalls, opens and conversion events (via a private Facebook API). When trying to figure out differences, it's best to pick one event at a time (e.g. clicks or installs) and focus on causes of discrepancies there.

Example with 3 day view attribution window: If a user views your ad and 2 days later installs your app, that install would be attributed to that ad view. However if the user views your ad and 4 days later installs the app, that install would be considered an organic install and would NOT be attributed to that ad view.  You can read more in our documentation  here  If one of your attribution windows on the Branch dashboard is different than the corresponding window on the Facebook dashboard, the data between the two will not align. You can mitigate this by changing one of more of your attribution windows on the Branch dashboard, or changing your Facebook dashboard for the given ad account.  There are four Branch attribution windows, and two Facebook attribution windows. This chart shows which Facebook window name each Branch window name corresponds to:     Branch window name  Facebook window name      Click to install  Click Window    Click to session start  Click Window    Click to conversion event  Click Window    Impression to install  View Window    Impression to session start  View Window    Impression to conversion event  View Window     Change your Facebook attribution windows  In order to update your Facebook Attribution window for a particular ad account, you can go to  https://business.facebook.com/ads/manager/account_settings/information . Choose the account in the dropdown in the upper-left corner. As long as you're an admin on that account, you should see a section 'Attribution' at the top-right, and an ability to edit the Click or View window or both.  Change your Branch attribution windows  Alternatively or in addition, you could update any of your four Branch attribution windows. To do so go to the  Link Settings  section of the Branch dashboard, and scroll down to the 'Attribution Windows' section and expand it. Alter any of the four windows listed in the chart above to match the corresponding Facebook window, and then save at the bottom of the page.  Reporting based on time of impression or time of conversion  Facebook and Branch may report the same install as occurring on different days, if the impression is on one day but the install is on another day.  Background:  Facebook by defaults reports installs based on the day that the impression occurred. They also allow you to see reports based on the day that the install occurred.  Branch always reports installs based on the date of install, never the date of impression.  Let's illustrate this with a scenario:  User views an ad on Apil 1, clicks it, then installs the app on April 2.  By default, Facebook reports the install as occurring on April 1. However, when pulling data from the insights API, you can specify option action_report_time=conversion. This causes Facebook to report that the install occurred on April 2.  Branch will always report the install as having occurred on April 2.",

So if you have a 30-day attribution window for click-to-install on Branch, and a 7-day window for clicks on Facebook, once you change the Branch click-to-install attribution window to 7 days, it will not automatically update historical numbers. Instead, you'll need to wait for new installs to occur under the stricter 7-day Branch click-to-install attribution window. The next day you should be able to come back and look at just the current day's install numbers, and they should line up more closely.

This prevents you from testing deep linking from your Facebook ads . Do not waste time trying to get this to work. We've confirmed with Facebook representatives that this is broken.  The only way to test the deep linking functionality is outside of the actual ads system is a helper tool from Facebook. Follow these instructions to test the deep linking functionality:   Head to the  Ads tester tool  Choose the app that you're advertising with  Scroll down to the button that says 'Test Deep Link'  Paste in the Branch link  Check 'Send Deferred'  Click 'Send to iOS/Android'  Install the app and it should deep link!    Note the following common mistakes for testing   If you reset the GAID or IDFA on a device, you must uninstall Facebook and re-install prior to testing. Facebook does not update the IDFA/GAID every time it's opened.  Send deferred does not require a notification to be sent or to be clicked. Checking \"Send Deferred\" will automatically queue up a match for the test device with the deep link data. The notifiation is completely separate from deferred deep linking.  The Facebook account on the desktop where you click \"Send Deferred\" must match the account logged into the test device for deferred deep link data to be queued up. Note that we've observed issues where you log in and out of multiple accounts on test devices that cause Facebook to not correctly queue up a match.

This means that there is something corrupted in the OG tags causing Facebook to not parse your link.    Rescrape the OG Tags  You can test the OG tags using the  OG tag tester tool  provided by Facebook:   Paste the Branch Link into the Input URL box.  Click on the Show existing scrape information button.  Examine errors regarding App Links from the output window.  Click on the Fetch New Scrape Information button. This last step typically resolves this problem if you are certain that your Branch Link Settings are correct.    You can further automate the rescraping process by using this command after you create a new link and before you use it for any ads:  curl --insecure  https://graph.facebook.com/?id=[YOUR-URL-TO-SCRAPE] scrape=true    If the OG tag tester continues to report problems   Examine your  Link Settings  and ensure that for all platforms (for which an app is available), that a URI scheme and a link to the app in the Play/App Store is configured. If you are using a Custom URL for your iOS Redirect, then you need to append  ?id[10-digit App Store ID]  to the URL. This is necessary in order to fully generate the App Links and OG tags that the Facebook scraper expects to find.  For example, if your App Store URL is  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-app-name/id1234567890 , then your Custom URL value should be  https://example.com?id1234567890    If errors from the output window pertain to OG tags i.e. missing title, description etc. then examine link OG tags by appending  ?debug=true  as described on the  Integration Testing page .  If you haven't set OG tags on a per link level, then please check your Dashboard's global Social Media Display Customization settings from the  Link Settings  page.   Use a direct deep link  As a last resort, you can manually input a direct deep link.
